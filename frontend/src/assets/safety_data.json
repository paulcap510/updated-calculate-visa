    "Safety and Security": "On August 31, the U.S. Embassy suspended services. Please read the  Afghanistan Travel Advisory which advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan and those in Afghanistan should shelter in place. The security situation is extremely unstable and the threat to U.S. citizens remains critical. No province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. U.S. citizens who do decide to come to Afghanistan should maintain a low profile and exercise extreme discretion in disclosing their movement plans and personal information. Security alerts for Afghanistan can be found here. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorist Attacks: Decades of disorder and warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terrorism. U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals are primary targets of terrorist organizations. Extremist groups across Afghanistan continue to utilize a variety of tactics to expand their territorial influence, disrupt governance, and create a public perception of instability. Such tactics include the use of attackers laden with suicide vests, vehicle-borne explosive devices, magnetic explosive devices, indirect fire (rockets and mortars), and direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades). Military and security personnel, Afghan government buildings, foreign embassies, non-government organization offices, and soft targets, such as hotels, markets, schools, hospitals, and public gatherings, are common attack targets. Kabul has been and remains a high-profile location for large-scale insurgent attacks, as successful operations in the capital tend to generate media coverage. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should familiarize themselves with their residential compound or hotel\u2019s emergency planning and rehearse the steps they would take if the venue were to come under attack. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Kidnapping/Hostage Taking: Extremist groups and kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals, specifically U.S. citizens, in Afghanistan, including journalists, aid workers, teachers, medical professionals, and individuals associated with international and non-governmental organizations. Criminal groups in Afghanistan will target any individual perceived to have money for kidnapping and/or extortion. Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates may also sell their captives to terrorist groups, with victims potentially spending years in captivity. Demonstrations and Riots: U.S. citizens should avoid all rallies and demonstrations, as even events intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence with little warning. Public gatherings and demonstrations have also been the targets of terrorist attacks. Property/Business Disputes: Afghan-Americans returning to Afghanistan to recover property often become involved in complicated real estate disputes involving threats of retaliatory action, including kidnapping and assassinations. Similarly, U.S. citizens involved in business or commercial disputes have been threatened with detention, arrest, and imprisonment, and had their property seized to use as collateral. U.S. citizens have reported being physically attacked and family members have also been harmed as the result of such disputes. U.S. citizens who find themselves in such situations should not assume that either local law enforcement or the U.S. Embassy will be able to assist them in resolving such disputes. Hiring a private attorney, early on the dispute, especially one who can act on behalf of the U.S. citizen when he/she is outside Afghanistan, is recommended. Communications: Large parts of Afghanistan are extremely isolated and landline telephone communications remain limited. Cell phone service is unpredictable, and areas outside major urban centers suffer from irregular and weak signals. Insurgents have been known to attack telecommunications infrastructure and coerce operators into turning off cell phone towers. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should always carry backup communications such as satellite phones or handheld radios, along with a vehicle/personal tracking device. Crime: Afghanistan is considered a critical threat environment for crime. Criminal organizations, including weapons and narcotics traffickers, undermine peace and stability throughout the country. Common petty or street crime exists, primarily in cities. Transient populations and internally displaced peoples may contribute to crime and lawlessness. Victims of Crime: There is no U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. The local equivalent to the U.S. \u201c911\u201d emergency line is \u201c119\u201d in Afghanistan. Please note that local operators do not speak English and that emergency services are restricted to the major cities. The emergency line may not be answered, and response times are usually longer than in the United States. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime committed in Afghanistan, but travelers should not rely on significant assistance from such authorities in resolving legal disputes. This is especially true of U.S.-based companies and their employees seeking local protection from extralegal efforts to resolve contract disputes. Property may be seized, and personnel may be detained as collateral pending the resolution of such disputes. See the Department of State\u2019s webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas for additional details. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage."

    "country_name": "Albania",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism:  Some terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Credit card fraud is common in Albania, and you should exercise caution by not letting your card out of sight when making a transaction. Visitors need to be very careful when using ATMs. Be alert for strangers looking over your shoulders at the PIN number, and also for any interference with the machine itself that could indicate a camera or card scanner that steals your details when you scan your card. Carjacking is rare in Albania, but vehicle theft may occur. Make sure your vehicle is locked and keep your possessions well hidden in the trunk. Recent crime statistics indicate a decrease in numerous violent crime categories to include attempted murder, robberies by force and armed robberies. Street crime is common in urban areas, predominantly at night. The most notable are burglaries, theft, and domestic violence claims. Attacks using small improvised explosive devices and targeting individuals in contentious disputes have occurred. Remain vigilant when parking in unattended parking areas, avoid parking overnight in non-secure areas, and inspect vehicles for suspicious items. If you find something strange, do not tamper with it and contact the Albanian Police immediately. Law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect and assist travelers is limited in some areas, especially in remote regions. There has been targeted violence associated with illicit drug networks and organized crime countrywide. Travelers should remain aware of their surroundings and the extent of police and emergency services in their area. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(355) 4 224 7285. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. The Embassy may be able to assist crime victims with the following: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is regulated, but rules may be unevenly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Professional and certified staff may not be available to support some organized activities. In the event of an injury, access to appropriate medical treatment may be sporadic due to limited hours or physical distances. Outside metropolitan areas, it may take more time to reach first responders or medical professionals who can stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage."

    "country_name": "Algeria",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorist Activity: While Algeria has long been an important counterterrorism partner to the United States and has continued its aggressive campaign to eliminate all terrorist activity, active terrorist threats remain within Algeria and along its borders, in particular from the groups Al-Qa\u2019ida in the Islamic Maghreband Jund al-Khilafah in Algeria, which has sworn allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS). Terrorist attacks usually target Algerian government interests and security forces outside of major cities and mainly in mountainous and remote areas, and attacks in 2020 and 2022 targeting Law Enforcement facilities were foiled but killed and injured security forces in the border regions of the southern wilayas of Bordj Badji Mokhtar and In Guezzam. The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to remote areas in southern and eastern Algeria, due to a high threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping. As noted in our Travel Advisories for Algeria, U.S. citizens should: avoid travel to rural areas within 50 km (31 miles) of the border with Tunisia and within 250 km (155 miles) of the borders with Libya, Niger, Mali, and Mauritania due to terrorist and criminal activities. avoid overland travel across the Sahara. Travel to Saharan cities only by air. remain on principal highways when traveling to coastal/mountainous areas east of Algiers and the mountains immediately south of Algiers. always travel with reputable Algerian travel agents who know the area. avoid staying overnight outside of the main cities and tourist locations. inform local police when staying in locations outside of major cities. Terrorist groups remain active throughout Algeria, though Algerian military operations over the past several years have been very successful in countering terrorist activity. Over the past five years, the government reported a total of 24 major attacks, though none were conducted in 2021. While these groups typically target Algerian security services and local government targets, they still aspire to target Western interests. AQIM, AQIM-allied groups and ISIS elements, including the Algerian affiliate locally known as Jund al-Khilafah in Algeria (JAK-A, or ISIS-Algeria), remain present, though they are assessed to have limited capabilities as a result of successful Algerian counterterrorism operations. Three major attacks occurred throughout 2020. In February, assailants targeted an army outpost in Bordj Badji Mokhtar, near the border with Mali, with a suicide vehicle borne improvised explosive device (SVBIED). ISIS-Algeria claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed one Algerian soldier. In June, assailants ambushed an army patrol in Ain Defla, killing one, and an IED attack in Medea killed two soldiers one week later; AQIM claimed both attacks. Government sources reported nearly 250 counter-terrorism operations throughout the year which resulted in over 120 terrorists arrested or captured and over 200 hideouts discovered and destroyed. Almost all reported terrorist attacks in the past five years have targeted Algerian security forces and involved IEDs or ambush tactics as suspects actively fled through rural mountainous regions. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime:  The crime rate in Algeria is moderate. Algeria has a very visible police presence throughout the country, as well as many plain-clothes police officers. Petty theft and home burglary occur frequently in low income areas, and occasionally in affluent neighborhoods. Theft of contents and parts from parked cars, pick-pocketing, theft on trains and buses, theft of items left in hotel rooms, and purse snatching can occur. Only stay in hotels where adequate security is provided. The U.S. Embassy has seen several cases in which American citizen women who meet an Algerian man online are lured to Algeria for marriage and are then held against their will in abusive situations. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Algeria.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at (213) 770-08-2000. The crime emergency lines in Algeria are 1548 and 17; for gendarmes, call 1055. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation   and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

    "country_name": "Angola",
    "Safety and Security": "Both spontaneous and planned civil disturbances and demonstrations, primarily related to governance and economic issues, can occur. U.S. citizens should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness at all times. Landmines are a risk throughout the country outside major cities. Crime: Armed assailants have killed some victims of muggings, robberies, and car-jackings, which occur frequently in all areas of the country. In fall 2019, a rash of violent robberies ended in homicides in Luanda.  The most commonly used tactic involves two individuals on a motorcycle who follow their victim to rob, usually at gunpoint. Criminals also target women by themselves, driving or walking. Lastly, motorcycles staging an accident is a tactic used to get you to stop and to lure you out of your vehicle or allow the criminals to enter your vehicle allegedly to take them to the hospital. Vehicle thefts, purse snatching, and theft from vehicles occur in areas frequented by foreigners. Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property like watches, jewelry, or smart phones. Vary your routes and travel times and let someone know your daily routine. Dress conservatively. Drive with doors and windows locked and windows rolled up. Keep valuables out of sight and do not use cell phones or laptops while stopped in traffic; criminals often brandishing guns use smash and grab tactics to steal valuables. Travel with a certified copy of your U.S. passport and Angolan visa to prevent the originals from being taken. Keep original documents in a secure location. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: The local equivalent to the \u201c911\u201d emergency line in Angola is 111: for police it\u2019s 113; for firefighters, 115; and for ambulance services, 112. Emergency numbers listed may not have an English-speaking operator available. Responses from emergency services are frequently severely delayed and may not be available outside Luanda. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Due to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, victims of violent crime, especially rape, are strongly encouraged to seek immediate medical assistance. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. The U.S. Embassy can: Help you find appropriate medical care, Assist you in reporting a crime to the police, Contact relatives or friends with your written consent, Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms, Provide a list of local attorneys, Provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the United States, Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution, Replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not widely available in-country.

    "country_name": "Argentina",
    "Safety and Security": "Demonstrations occur frequently in Buenos Aires and take place in other cities as well.  Protesters often block streets and highways.  Demonstrations are usually nonviolent, but always have the potential to turn confrontational.  Avoid demonstrations if possible. Crime:  Street crime is a problem in most urban areas including Buenos Aires City (San Telmo, La Boca, Retiro, Florida Street), Buenos Aires province, Rosario, and Mendoza. Areas with higher levels of violent crime include Rosario, and the Buenos Aires suburbs of Lomas de Zamora, Quilmes, and Moreno. Look out for muggers, pickpockets, scam artists, cellphone and purse-snatchers who work on the street, in restaurants and hotel lobbies, at bus and train stations, in public transportation, and in cruise ship ports. Robberies occur often, and violence is more likely to occur when victims resist. Do not leave your personal belongings unattended. Frequent robberies of luggage and handbags occur at Retiro bus station in Buenos Aires and the bus station in Mendoza, and when leaving a handbag in the overhead compartment on the bus. Robberies involving motorcycles (called \u201cmotochorros\u201d) occur frequently in cities. These thieves normally operate in pairs:  one to jump off and take the watches, purses, and backpacks of pedestrians, and another to operate the bike. The motochorros also reach, or break, into cars to snatch valuable items. Although the La Boca neighborhood is a well-known tourist destination, there have been violent robberies in the daytime as well as nighttime. Stay on the main streets in the tourist zone and use radio taxis to and from the neighborhood. Avoid \u201cvillas\u201d or shanty towns in Buenos Aires, other major cities, and provinces, even if they are in tourist zones. Scams involving yellow and black taxis have been reported at international airports and around Buenos Aires. Pre-arrange a ride or select one of the flat-rate \u201cremise\u201d services (private car with driver) from the airport service counters. In town, use radio taxis from places like a hotel when possible.  See the Department of State and the FBI Financial Crime I pages for information on scams.  A few common scenarios follow: Drivers pretend to help tourists with money while trading good bills for counterfeit ones. A \u201chandler\u201d at the airport accepts payment for the ride, but then the driver also demands money at the end of the ride. The taxi \u201cbreaks down\u201d on the road, and a second taxi comes to get the passenger.  Both drivers demand payment. Spraying mustard or another substance on the tourist from a distance.  An accomplice robs the victim while pretending to help clean the stain. Protestors (\u2018piqueteros\u2019) sometimes block major roads during large protests and can cause significant traffic delays. Climbing, Hiking, and Trekking: Do not trek alone. The U.S. Embassy in Argentina strongly discourages U.S. citizens from hiking alone or even separating from larger traveling parties while on a trail. In recent years, U.S. citizens and other foreigners have disappeared or been seriously injured while solo climbing/hiking and trekking. Sexual assaults have been reported against solo hikers and bikers on trails in regions along the border with Chile.  Hike in groups and remain alert to your surroundings. Follow Park Ranger and Search and Rescue Team advice and instructions. Update your SOS or GPS emergency locator information. Make sure your device is enabled to function in the park and your provider has the correct information for authorities. Add local rescue teams as your first emergency contact (see recourses below) and add the U.S. Embassy\u2019s emergency contact phone number as an alternative: +54-11 5777-4354. Before your trip you can check the following resources for reliable information about trail conditions and potential hazards in the most popular climbing, hiking and trekking regions in Argentina: \u00b7         Mendoza: Mendoza, Aconcagua \u00b7         Bariloche: Club Andino \u00b7         El Chalten: El Chalt\u00e9n We strongly recommend that before you travel you purchase supplemental travel and evacuation insurance, provide family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to climbing, trekking, and hiking, and Register your itinerary through the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). Please note: The Department of State assumes no responsibility or liability for the entities on the weblink list above. Inclusion on this list is in no way an endorsement by the Department or the U.S. government. The information on the links is provided directly by the local service providers; the Department is not in a position to vouch for such information Precautions include: Do not place handbags on the back of your chair or on the floor at a restaurant.  Keep them in your lap. Do not leave your drink unattended. Do not leave cellphones on tables at restaurants. Sexual assaults have been reported against solo hikers and bikers on trails in regions along the border with Chile.  Hike in groups and remain alert to your surroundings. Robberies also occur where victims are grabbed and forced to take out as much money as possible from ATMs.  Family or co-workers are contacted and told to bring all the cash they have on hand or can gather in a couple of hours.  Once the ransom is paid, the victim is usually released unharmed.  There have been some foreign victims of these robberies. Fake telephone kidnappings are also common. Learning important phone numbers and, if robbed, immediately finding a phone and letting family members know you are alright are important steps in stopping this crime. Travelers should not pack valuables in checked bags. The U.S. Embassy receives many reports of stolen passports.  Passports and other valuables should be locked in a hotel safe.  Carry a photocopy of your passport with you.  In addition, U.S. citizen residents and visitors should safeguard personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, banking and other information, to protect against identity theft. Victims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at the numbers below and contact the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires: Dial 911 to report emergencies, call the police, an ambulance, or the fire department. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, vehicles and rudimentary IEDs\u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. The Nagorno-Karabakh Area and Conflict: The U.S. Government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. Exercise caution near the Azerbaijan-Armenia border. Despite the declaration of a cessation in hostilities, the danger posed by intermittent gunfire, land mines, and poor road conditions continue. Roads near the conflict zone may be controlled by checkpoints or closed to travelers without notice. For more information regarding business and commercial activities in these areas, please visit the Investment Climate Statement.          U.S. citizens of Armenian descent may encounter anti-Armenian sentiments in Azerbaijan. Exercise caution in the region of Nardaran, located approximately 28 miles (45 km) from Baku on the Absheron Peninsula. Nardaran is culturally conservative and has been the site of several anti-United States and anti-Israel protests. It has also been the subject of government raids, which have sometimes resulted in violence. Crime: Crime is relatively low and violent crime is infrequent. The majority of reported crimes involve burglary, assault, or petty crime such as pickpocketing. Be careful in areas that attract large crowds or are very isolated. Criminals have targeted foreigners walking alone, late at night, or under the influence of alcohol. Some women have reported incidents of unwanted male attention while walking alone and taking taxis. Sexual assault may be underreported due to cultural stigma. Financial scams are increasingly common. While the majority involves internet dating, there are reports of scams related to fraudulent real estate deals, licensing requirements, and travel advertisements. There are reports of increased credit and bank card fraud, such as credit card skimming. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Avoid demonstrations and riots, which police have previously suppressed with force. Demonstrations occur periodically. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizens who are victims of crime should report crimes to the local police and then contact the U.S. Embassy. Contact the local police by dialing 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+994 12) 488 3300. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

    "Safety and Security": "Crime: The Department of State rates the criminal threat level in New Providence Island (includes Nassau and Paradise Island) as critical. The vast majority of crime occurs on New Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama (Freeport) Islands. Criminal activity on the outlying Family Islands does occur, but to a much lesser degree than on New Providence or Grand Bahama. In Nassau, exercise caution in the \u201cOver the Hill\u201d area (south of Shirley Street). Violent crime such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assaults occur, but generally not in tourist areas. For the latest security messages, visit our website.

Adventure Tourism: Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated. Watercraft are often not maintained, and many companies do not have safety certifications to operate in The Bahamas. Reconsider going on the water in rough seas or inclement weather, as accidents and fatalities have occurred in such conditions. U.S. citizens seeking to engage in adventure tourism-related activities, including boat tours, are strongly encouraged to confirm the following with any tour operator: Credentials and certification to operate in The Bahamas Liability in the event of an accident Safety and rescue protocols for guides Jet-Ski Operators: Jet-ski operators have been known to commit sexual assaults against tourists. As a result, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to use independently operated jet-ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Islands. Watersports Advisory: Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities and consider your physical capabilities and skills. Be aware of sharks when in or on the water, as shark bites do occur and can result in serious injury or death. Never venture out alone, particularly at isolated beaches or far out to sea. Avoid entering the water above your waist if you have been drinking and always be mindful of jet ski and boat traffic in the area. Do not engage in water activities during times of inclement weather or rough seas. Commercial watercraft operators have discretion to operate their vessels regardless of weather forecasts; injuries and fatalities have occurred. Hurricanes: Hurricane season generally runs from June through November, although hurricanes can occur outside that period. Monitor local weather reports closely. Airports and seaports cease operations well before a predicted storm arrives, and seats on most commercial transportation may sell out far in advance.  For more information on hurricane preparedness, please refer to the Department of State\u2019s page on Crisis Abroad and the U.S. Embassy Nassau\u2019s Hurricane Preparedness page. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.

Crime:  The crime rate in Bahrain is low, and violent crime is rare. Thieves and pickpockets are known to operate in the old market area.  Common sense security precautions are effective in countering the threat of crime. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, during international events, at night and on weekends. Such activity is usually confined to specific neighborhoods and is rarely widespread or impacts public order.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Demonstrations sometimes result in blocked highways and unofficial checkpoints.  Protestors occasionally throw rocks, lob Molotov cocktails, and in the past have used improvised explosive devices and shotgun-like projectile launchers against government forces.  The Ministry of Interior maintains official checkpoints and will deploy crowd control agents against demonstrators if it is determined that the protest is becoming unruly or could impact the security environment.  In recent years, dialogue and community policing elements have been used to lower tensions and crowd control measures have been as a last resort. No U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted during protest activity. Local media outlets have sometimes expressed anti-U.S. sentiment, and demonstrators have occasionally burned U.S. flags.  Remain alert to local security developments.  For assistance, call the local police at 999.

    "Safety and Security": "Crime: U.S. citizens are not specifically targeted for crime in Barbados. However, crimes of opportunity such as petty larceny, burglary, automobile break-ins; as well as incidents of violent crime, such as murder, sexual assault, robbery, shootings, and drug related crimes do occasionally occur. As you would in any major metropolitan area of the U.S., use the below personal security measures while traveling: Do not leave valuables unattended in public areas, on beaches, unsecured in hotel rooms, or in rental homes. Avoid walking alone, especially at night, on beaches, and in isolated or poorly lit locations. Go out in groups or with a companion and limit nighttime activities to established safe and reputable venues. Use only clearly marked taxis and avoid rides with strangers. Stick to well-lit and well-traveled routes. Avoid displaying flashy jewelry, expensive electronics, and large amounts of cash. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see something suspicious or unusual contact local police at #211 to report immediately. Use added caution when shopping in crowded areas, especially during the holiday season. Use added caution when attending crowded events, such as Crop Over, Kadooment celebrations, music festivals, etc. Do not leave drinks unattended in public venues as this could create a potential vulnerability for the use of \u201cdate rape\u201d drugs in furtherance of criminal activity. Do not be predictable; vary your daily routes and schedules. Prostitution and drug use (to include marijuana) is illegal, do not engage in illegal activity. Do not wear camouflage as it is illegal to wear in public. In Barbados exercise extra vigilance at night on party cruises and in the downtown area. Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. These are illegal in the United States, and you may also be breaking local law. Firearms: Do not enter Barbados with firearms or ammunition without prior express consent from the Barbados government. Please contact the Embassy of Barbados\u202fwith questions regarding travel with firearms.  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 211 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (246) 227-4000.  The emergency lines in Barbados are: Fire: 311, Police: 211, Ambulance: 511.

    "country_name": "Belarus",
    "Safety and Security": "Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks. All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Demonstrations intended to be peaceful can sometimes become confrontational. For this reason, it is recommended that U.S. citizens avoid all demonstrations and protest gatherings. Demonstrations, both organized and spontaneous, are infrequent in Belarus. Localized street disturbances relating to political events are more likely in Minsk or larger cities than in smaller towns and villages. Authorities have used force to disperse demonstrators, including those who are peacefully demonstrating. Bystanders, including foreign nationals, may face the possibility of arrest or detention.  Foreigners may be placed under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.  Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with authorities; these sites are not always clearly marked and application of these restrictions is subject to interpretation.  Crime: Belarus has a low rate of street crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare; criminals have been known to use force if met with resistance from victims.  Common street crime, such as mugging and pickpocketing, occurs most frequently near public transportation venues, near hotels frequented by foreigners, and/or at night in poorly-lit areas. Exercise caution when visiting bars, casinos and night clubs, and do not leave your drink unattended. There have been reports of travelers being drugged and subsequently robbed or assaulted while visiting night clubs. Prostitutes at hotels may attempt to open hotel room doors in search of customers. Local and transnational organized criminal activity exists in Belarus. Most casinos and adult clubs are operated by criminal elements and should be avoided. Theft of vehicle parts and car vandalism is common. Sport-utility and luxury vehicles tend to be the most sought-after. Parking in a secure area overnight is highly recommended. Internet-Dating Schemes and Cyber-Crime: \"Internet brides\" are advertised on several websites and are not always legitimate. Often, potential suitors in the United States lose thousands of dollars sending money to people they have never met and will never hear from again. In some cases, the foreigner is invited to visit Belarus; the Belarusian \u201cfriend\u201d collects money for lodging and transportation expenses and then disappears. Cyber-crime is well developed in Belarus. Merchandise orders with fraudulent credit cards, ID theft, hacking/blackmail schemes, and advance-fee fraud are gaining in popularity. If doing business electronically with persons or firms in Belarus, proceed with extreme caution. Use only ATMs located inside major banks. Use of credit and debit cards is not recommended; there have been reports of U.S. citizens having their ATM or credit cards skimmed resulting in fraudulent charges or money stolen from their accounts. Be aware that due to a lack of tourism infrastructure in Belarus, transferring funds from abroad, replacing stolen traveler's checks or airline tickets, or canceling credit cards can be difficult in Belarus. Counterfeit and pirated goods are widely available. Transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. In addition, bringing them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines. Sophisticated criminal investigations may be inconclusive because of a lack of resources and/or political will. We have received reports of harassment of U.S. citizens at border crossings. We recommend that you report any crimes immediately to the local police and to the U.S. Embassy in Minsk. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.   Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +375 17 210 1283. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime that occurs in Belarus.  The local equivalents to the \u201c911\u201d emergency lines in Belarus are: 101 for Fire and Rescue Squad; 102 for Police; and 103 for Ambulance (Medical Emergency).

Crime: Low-level street crime including robberies, smash and grab car robberies, purse snatchings, stealing electronics, and pickpocketing is common, particularly in major cities, in public areas such as restaurants, the Brussels metro at night, buses/trams, and all train stations. Thieves often operate in teams, by bumping into or shoving the target, especially in crowds. Be alert to distractions. Theft from vehicles is common. Always drive with your windows up and the doors locked, as thieves sometimes target cars stopped at traffic lights. Thieves may smash the window and grab valuables. Use parking garages when possible, and if you must use street parking, look for a spot near a street light. Do not leave anything visible on the seats, floor, or dashboard. Theft of bags on trains has increased, particularly the Brussels-Amsterdam route. Thieves often target light bags placed overhead. Keep bags with cash, valuables, and travel documents close to you, rather than in the overhead shelf on trains. Carry only a minimal amount of cash, credit cards, and necessary personal identification.  Avoid wearing expensive jewelry and watches. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Police routinely monitor protestors and demonstrations. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Monitor the Embassy website for demonstration alerts.   International Financial Scams: U.S. citizens have lost tens of thousands of dollars in scams in Belgium. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for more information. Common internet scams include confidence schemes, in which friends, family, or others receive a message that a U.S. citizen traveler is stranded in Belgium and in need of funds to pay for customs fees. U.S. citizens in the United States who have been victimized by Internet crime should report it to the Internet Crime Complaint Center. Check ATMs or other machines for skimmers or removeable readers. When possible utilize bank ATMs. In bars and restaurants, have the card swiped in front of you and do not let it be taken away. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 101. For all other emergencies, please dial 112. Contact the U.S. Embassy at +(32) (2) 811-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. The Belgian Commission for Financial Assistance to Victims of Intentional Acts of Violence provides financial compensation, under specific circumstances, for victims of crime and for those who have suffered injuries and consequent losses caused by such incidents. The Commission also provides for dependents or immediate family members of homicide victims.

    "country_name": "Belize",
    "Safety and Security": "Belize is rated high for crime and has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Gang members and other criminals use violent means to resolve disputes. Visitors should exercise caution throughout Belize, particularly in the south side of Belize City and remote areas along Belize\u2019s borders due to high crime. Crime: Crime may occur anywhere in Belize, and criminals frequently target tourists, including those at resorts and on the roads and river ways. Crime, including sexual assault, armed robbery, and murder remains high and is distributed evenly throughout the country. Sexual harassment and/or assault of persons traveling alone or in small groups have been reported.  Most crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted. A lack of capacity, resources, and training impedes the ability of local police to effectively investigate crime and apprehend offenders. Thefts of cash and credit cards happen frequently in some areas of Belize. It is believed several credit card fraud rings are currently active in Belize, particularly in San Pedro. Scams occur in Belize, especially in resort areas. Tourists, in general, are particularly vulnerable to these crimes, resulting in visitors being pick-pocketed, robbed and/or extorted.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected and focused on vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Extremist groups have carried out attacks in areas of Burkina Faso adjacent to Benin\u2019s northern border, near Park Pendjari, Park W, and adjacent hunting zones. Attacks may occur with little or no warning. Western tourists have been kidnapped in Park Pendjari in northern Benin. U.S. government employees are restricted from personal travel to Park Pendjari, Park W, other areas within 50 km of Benin\u2019s northern border with Burkina Faso, and areas north of the RNIE 7 route from Banikoara to the Nigerian border (not including the cities of Kandi and Segbana). The U.S. Department of State recommends tourists reconsider travel to these areas. For more information, see our terrorism page. Crime: Street crime is a significant problem in urban areas. Robbery and muggings occur on major thoroughfares and in neighborhoods, including those where expatriates and diplomatic staff live, where popular bars and restaurants are located, and on the beaches near hotels frequented by international visitors. Most reported incidents involve the use of force, by armed persons, with minor injury to the victim. There have been reports of individuals impersonating police officers. Travelers should avoid the Dantokpa Market between the hours of dusk and dawn. Demonstrations occur occasionally. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Benin. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:  Romance/Online dating Money transfers Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Work permits/job offers Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at +(229) 21-30-30-25 or +(229) 21-30-20-11, and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(229) 21-30-75-00. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. Those who witness or are victimized by police fraud and/or corruption can call the \u201cGreen Line\u201d of the Beninese Police at 166 to report what they have experienced. The U.S. Embassy can: Help you find appropriate medical care. Assist you in reporting a crime to the police. Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. Provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion. Provide a list of local attorneys. Provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the United States. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution. Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home.  Replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is limited. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. Depending on the nature of an injury or illness, appropriate medical treatment may not be available in Benin. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. Beach Safety: Swimming conditions along Benin\u2019s coastline are dangerous due to strong tides, waves, and rip currents, and several people drown each year. Some private beaches offer increased protection, such as sea walls.  Always learn about the water conditions at any beach before attempting to swim. Maritime Security: Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship\u2019s property continue to be common occurrences."

    "country_name": "Bermuda",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime:\u202fBy comparison to the United States, Bermuda has a low to moderate crime rate. Recent crime statistics are available at the official website of the\u202fBermuda Police Service. Valuables left unattended in public areas, in unsecured hotel rooms, or on rental motorbikes are vulnerable to theft. Criminals have been known to target visitors on motorbikes and at popular tourist attractions, and purse snatchings, perpetrated by thieves riding motorbikes, and muggings have occurred in the past. The back streets of the City of Hamilton have been the setting for assaults, particularly at night after the bars close.  Travelers should exercise caution when walking after dark or visiting out-of-the-way places on the island as they can be vulnerable to theft and assault, and because narrow and dark roadways can contribute to accidents. Travelers should note the presence of gangs and illegal drug activity in Bermuda. There have been no reports of gang violence targeted towards visitors to Bermuda, although gang-related shooting incidents have occurred and continue to occur throughout the island. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Consulate for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police at 1 (441) 295-0011 and contact the U.S. Consulate at 1 (441) 295-1342.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

Beach Safety: Swimming areas at some popular beaches around Bermuda can have dangerous rip currents, and swimming in the ocean is not the same as swimming in a pool or lake. Wind, waves, the change of the tide, the slope of the beach, and other factors can cause strong currents and difficult swimming conditions to be present in the water even on the calmest days. U.S. citizens have drowned in Bermuda due to these conditions. Only swim when there is a lifeguard present and always remain in sight of them. Do not dive into water of unknown depth. Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while swimming.  For more information, please visit Beach and Ocean Safety | American Red Cross.  Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regards to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.\u202f Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.\u202f In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.\u202f Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.\u202f U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance."

    "Safety and Security": "Chapare and Yungas Regions: Organized criminal groups near Coroico and Carnavi in Yungas have committed carjackings and robberies. Additionally, government authorities have used force in past confrontations with residents over coca eradication, and pro-coca groups may attempt to target U.S. interests. Contact the Embassy before traveling to these regions. Crime: Pick pocketing and petty theft are common. Express kidnappings, in which tourists are robbed and forced to withdraw money from ATMs, occur infrequently in La Paz. Use only marked (radio) taxis and don\u2019t travel alone, particularly late at night or if you\u2019re under the influence of alcohol or other substances. Avoid Coronilla Hill in Cochabamba next to the main bus terminal, due to crime. Use caution if you plan to travel from Copacabana to La Paz by bus. Arrive during daylight hours if possible, verify the final destination, and buy tickets directly at the bus terminal. Be aware of impostors. Organized criminal groups sometimes pose as police with the intent to rob foreigners. It is also a common scheme for criminals to pose as a crime victim, only to rob an unsuspecting bystander. Theft of bags, wallets, and backpacks are a problem, especially in tourist areas and on overnight buses. Thieves sometimes distract victims by spraying water on their necks or placing a substance on their bags, and trick them into giving up their bags. Never leave personal items unattended. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Avoid roadblocks or public demonstrations. Consider the possibility of flight disruptions. Take extra food, water, and warm clothing on road trips. Roadblocks may occur without warning and could strand you for several days. Messages regarding demonstrations, strikes, and weather-related events are posted on the Embassy\u2019s website.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking soft targets and are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, rudimentary explosive devices, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)  Violent incidents: Local criminals use firearms and explosives to settle disputes, with the majority of incidents involving improvised explosives in Sarajevo occurring after dark. The foreign community is rarely targeted, but collateral damage can occur. See LGBTQI+ Travelers, below, for information regarding recent violent incidents targeting members of the LGBTQI+ community. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: The overall crime rate for the country is high, and Sarajevo has a high rate of property-related crime. The most common criminal activities in Sarajevo are robberies, residential break-ins, vehicle break-ins and theft, and pickpocketing. Pickpocketing occurs in areas frequented by tourists in Sarajevo. Be alert at all times, especially after dark and in locations frequented by tourists, such as caf\u00e9s, parking garages, shopping areas, and restaurants. Take normal precautions to protect your property from theft and employ personal security measures, such as traveling in groups and staying in well-lit areas after dark. Avoid carrying large sums of money. People wearing backpacks stand out and attract the attention of pickpockets. Landmines: Landmine explosions have injured over 1,200 and killed over 600 people in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1995. Minefields, active landmines, and unexploded ordnances are a threat throughout the country and deaths from explosions have occurred as recently as March 2023. Stay on hard surfaced areas and out of abandoned buildings.  Observe mine warning signs throughout the country.  Consult with the latest landmine maps via the Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Center. Regardless of an area\u2019s mine status, avoid unmarked trails. For more information about landmines and unexploded ordinance, please visit the website of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Center. Demonstrations can occur anywhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international or sporting events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Large demonstrations, even if peaceful, can create traffic congestion and lead to closures of public transportation, roadways, and sidewalks. Soccer matches: Rival fans occasionally fight and cause property damage and physical injuries. Plan ahead to avoid the area. Physical confrontations surrounding soccer matches have included  right-wing nationalist, racist, or anti-LGBTQI+ violence. Large groups of soccer fans can quickly become violent. Avoid crowds and large groups. Large crowds before and after matches can create significant traffic congestion, crowding at drinking and eating establishments, and problems for pedestrians. Road and sidewalk closures are common. Feral dogs: Avoid stray dogs. Packs or individual dog attacks occur in urban and rural areas and can be unpredictable. Though emergency medical facilities can treat dog bites and rabies vaccines are available, travelers should consider a series of pre-exposure rabies vaccinations prior to arrival. For further information, please consult the CDC\u2019s information on rabies. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

    "Safety and Security": "CRIME:  Non-confrontational crime and crimes of opportunity, primarily the theft of money and personal property, are common. Home invasions, break-ins, \u201csmash and grabs\u201d from vehicles at intersections and from locked cars in shopping mall parking lots, cell phone thefts, and muggings - often at knife point, are routinely reported to police. Hotels and lodges are not immune from criminal activity. Visitors should remain alert and take reasonable precautions to safeguard personal property (particularly money and electronic equipment). Crime is also reported in game parks, nature reserves, and remote areas frequented by tourists.  You should:   avoid walking alone, particularly at night   exercise caution near Kgale Hill (a popular hiking site) in Gaborone due to frequent criminal incidents;  promptly comply if confronted by criminals as resistance may result in severe injury;   avoid crowds, political rallies, and demonstrations;   always maintain security awareness.   Travelers arriving in Botswana via South Africa should be aware of serious and continuing baggage pilferage problems at OR Tambo (Johannesburg) and Cape Town International Airports. It is suggested that you:   use an airport plastic wrapping service;   avoid placing valuables in checked luggage;   make an inventory of items in checked baggage to file claims if theft does occur;   if asked to gate check a piece of hand luggage, transfer high value items and prescription drugs into a carry-on bag.

    "country_name": "Brazil",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: The violent crime rate is high in most Brazilian urban centers. Public transportation, hotel sectors, and tourist areas report high crime rates, but these incidents can happen anywhere and at any time. Be aware of your surroundings. Do not travel to: Informal housing developments in Brazil (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, comunidades, and/or satellite cities), even on a guided tour, at any time of day due to crime. Neither the tour companies nor the police can guarantee your safety when entering these areas. Even in favelas that the police or local governments deem safe, the situation can change quickly and without notice. In addition, exercise caution in areas surrounding favelas, as occasionally, inter-gang fighting and confrontations with police move beyond the confines of these communities. Brasilia\u2019s administrative regions (commonly known as \u201csatellite cities\u201d) of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa during non-daylight hours due to crime. Any areas within 150 km of Brazil\u2019s land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay due to crime. (Note: This does not apply to the Foz do Iguacu National Park or Pantanal National Park.) Consider avoiding the use of public, municipal buses in Brazil at any time of day, and especially at night. Crime trends indicate an elevated risk of robbery or assault on public bus systems throughout Brazil. The U.S. government recommends against personnel using public, municipal buses in all parts of Brazil. U.S. citizens in Brazil should be alert to the widespread use of sedatives to drug and rob individuals, including incidents involving U.S. citizens and many more involving other tourists. According to reports, the victims believe their drinks were tampered with. They report that they have very little recollection of events and realized their valuables were missing after losing and regaining consciousness. While victims continue to be randomly targeted in bars and nightclubs, foreigners are also targeted through online dating applications. We recommend taking the following steps to avoid this type of crime: Avoid going to bars or nightclubs alone and avoid leaving with strangers. Do not accept food or drinks from strangers. Before going on a date with someone you met on a dating app, tell a loved one who you are meeting, where you are going, and the details of the dating application account. Be wary about inviting individuals to your residence. If inviting a new acquaintance to your residence, speak to your door attendant in advance about your invited guest. Trust your instincts \u2013 if something does not feel right or if you suddenly feel ill, walk away from the situation. If you believe you may have been drugged, seek immediate medical attention. Some people can have life-threatening reactions to these drugs. After that, report the crime to local police and contact us at the numbers listed below. In addition, be aware of the following situations: Traveling Outside Metropolitan Areas After Dark: Travelers are encouraged to organize their trips so that they can travel during daylight hours. Road conditions throughout Brazil can vary widely, and travelers must exercise caution due to debris in the road, horse-drawn carriages, unmarked speed bumps, and other infrastructure deficiencies. Armed hold-ups of pedestrians and motorists can happen, including at or near public beaches. Personal belongings, left unattended even for a moment, are often taken. If you are robbed, hand over your personal belongings without resisting. Resisting will increase your risk of injury. Carjackings and hold-ups can occur at any time of the day or night, especially at intersections and in tunnels. Some robberies involve individuals robbed at gunpoint and taken to make purchases or to withdraw as much money as possible from one or more ATMs. Crime on public transportation occurs. Registered taxis have red license plates and openly display company information and phone numbers. Credit card fraud and ATM scams are common in Brazil. Work closely with your financial institutions to monitor accounts and keep your credit card in view while it is scanned at a point of sale. Avoid using ATMs in unfamiliar, secluded, or lightly protected areas. Be aware that criminals often target ATMs and businesses in the early hours of the morning when there are fewer witnesses and law enforcement response times may be delayed. If you opt to use an ATM, select those that are located inside of secure facilities, such as an airport, hospital, bank, or government building.  Avoid openly displaying your cell phone.\u202f When using a ride share service or taxi, wait for its arrival in a secure area. Avoid large groups or events where crowds have gathered. Public events of any nature, including concerts and sporting events, can unexpectedly turn violent. U.S. government employees working in Brazil are not permitted to: Travel to any areas within 150 km of the international borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay, except in limited circumstances with the appropriate U.S. Department of State approvals. Individuals with ties to illegal criminal networks operate along Brazilian borders. Travel to the Foz do Igua\u00e7u National Park and Pantanal National Park is permitted. Enter any informal housing developments in Brazil (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, comunidades, and/or satellite cities), except in limited circumstances with the appropriate approvals. Enter Brasilia\u2019s administrative regions (commonly known as \u201csatellite cities\u201d) of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa during non-daylight hours. To reduce the chance of becoming the victim of a crime, in addition to the above recommendations, please review the below precautions: Limit the personal belongings you carry with you. Carry your money in your front pockets and limit the number of credit cards you carry. Make copies of all of your personal documents \u2013 including your credit cards, license, passport, etc. \u2013 and keep them in a safe place. This will be helpful if you lose your documents. Do not carry or wear valuable items that will attract the attention of thieves. If you need to wear expensive jewelry or carry a camera, conceal it until you arrive at your destination. Be aware of the street environment and avoid contact with those who may be looking for robbery targets. Seek a safer location. Go into a store, bank, or simply cross the street. Do not walk on beaches after dark. Assaults are common. Use increased caution when hiking in isolated areas, particularly near popular tourist locations in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Demonstrations and strikes are common in urban areas, may occur unexpectedly, disrupt transportation, and may escalate into violence. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Check the website of the Embassy or Consulate nearest you for current information on demonstrations. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of crime should contact the local authorities to file a Brazilian police report before departing Brazil.

    "country_name": "Bulgaria",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)  Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists  Places of worship  Schools  Parks  Shopping malls and markets  Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)   The U.S. Department of State has assessed Sofia as being a LOW-threat location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. For more information, see our Terrorism page.   Crime: U.S. government personnel are not prohibited from traveling to any specific areas of Bulgaria due to crime. Most criminal acts in Bulgaria take place in Sofia. Other districts with a slightly lower level of crime than Sofia are Varna, Plovdiv, Burgas, and Stara Zagora. The lowest crime levels are in the districts of Smolyan, Kardzhali, Vidin, Silistra, and Razgrad. Most of Bulgaria experienced a decrease in crime in 2021 compared to 2020. ATM skimming, credit card fraud, and traffic incidents remain the most common threats to U.S. citizens in Bulgaria. Majority of incidents involving U.S. citizens are monetary in nature, though incidents of racism, ethnic slurs, and harassment of African Americans and religious minorities have occurred. Report crimes to the police by dialing 112. Pick pocketing and purse snatching are frequent occurrences, especially in crowded markets, on shopping streets, near airport ATMs and aboard the busy tram and bus lines. Con artists often operate on public transportation and in bus and train stations. Use caution at ATMs. Be wary of people who approach you at an ATM and offer assistance. Do not give your PIN to anyone under any circumstances. Police stations should provide translators for anyone who needs to report a crime but will often require the victim to return at a later time or bring his/her own translator. Use taxis with meters and clearly marked rates displayed on a sticker on the passenger side of the windshield. Taxi drivers are known to overcharge unwary travelers particularly at Sofia Airport, the Central Train Station, and at Black Sea resort areas. The airport has a clearly marked exit within the arrival terminal that leads travelers to metered taxis at a fair rate and a booth to assist with obtaining taxi services. Inquire about the fare before entering a taxi and always account for all luggage, packages, and hand-carried items before paying and releasing a taxi. Popular mobile application based taxi services like Uber or Lyft do not operate in Bulgaria, but there are local taxi services that use similar mobile applications such as Yellow Taxi and Taxime. Automobile theft and break-ins are common in residential areas and in parks. Four-wheel-drive vehicles and late-model European sedans are the most popular targets. Burglary is a common crime. If you plan to reside in Bulgaria on a long-term basis, take measures to protect your home and consider installing window grilles, steel doors with well-functioning locks, and an alarm system. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on significant holidays, and during international events. They mainly occur in downtown Sofia in the areas surrounding and between Parliament and the Presidency.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable; even those intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Exercise caution if unexpectedly found in the vicinity of large gatherings or demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. In an emergency, U.S. citizens should call the police (#112), seek a safe location, and wait for assistance. Messages regarding demonstrations are posted on the Embassy's website."

    "country_name": "Burkina Faso",
    "Safety and Security": "See the Department of State\u2019s Travel Advisory for Burkina Faso and Worldwide Caution for current security information. Terrorism: Violent extremist elements, remain active in Bukina Faso and throughout the region. They have specifically targeted Westerners in attacks and kidnappings. Since January 2016, extremist groups have conducted numerous cross-border attacks in the Sahel region. In addition to attacking police stations, customs offices, military posts, and schools in the Sahel region, extremists have attacked Ouagadougou three times since Janaury 2016. On March 2, 2018, extremists attacked the French Embassy and Burkina Faso\u2019s military headquarters in downtown Ouagadougou. Eight security force personnel, including soldiers and police officers, were killed, and over 80 others were injured. In August 2017, a small group of armed men attacked the Aziz Istanbul Caf\u00e9, a restaurant in downtown Ouagadougou, and killed approximately 19 people. Civil Unrest: Demonstrations may occur throughout Burkina Faso with little or no advance warning. Maintain a surplus of supplies including food, water, fuel, and medical supplies in case you need to shelter-in-place. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant and utilize appropriate personal security practices, including:  avoiding large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations; maintaining situational awareness and exercise good judgment; remaining alert and aware of your surroundings; staying abreast of current events through media outlets. Crime: Street crime is prevalent in major cities and foreigners are often directly targeted. Cellular telephones, jewelry, laptops, money and other items of value are the frequent targets of thieves. The majority of street crime is committed after dark and is often perpetrated by one or two individuals on motorbikes. Street crime typically increases in Ouagadougou around the holidays, the bi-annual West African Movie Festival (FESPACO), and the bi-annual Regional Craft Festival (SIAO). Remain vigilant in crowded areas and secure your personal belongings are at all times. Avoid traveling alone after dark as security risks increase at night. Be alert and aware of your surroundings, travel with a group of people if possible, and avoid poorly lit streets and narrow alleys. Criminals in urban areas may carry a knife or sharp weapon in order to cut the straps on bags, purses, or backpacks and can become violent if the victim resists. Ordinarily, thieves do not threaten victims with weapons, although there have been thefts and attempted thefts involving firearms and knives. Residential thefts/home invasions occur occasionally in the Ouagadougou expatriate community centered in Ouaga 2000, Koulouba, and Zone du Bois, and in other parts of Ouagadougou. Thieves enter residences at night but generally avoid direct confrontation with the occupants. Most perpetrators exploit an unlocked door or window. Travel in convoys when outside of major urban areas to deter roadside crime. Robberies can take place anwhere along the country\u2019s roads, but local police cite the Eastern Region beyond Koupela, toward Fada N\u2019Gourma due to its isolated location and intermittent cell phone coverage. According to police statistics, more than half of all reported roadside robbery incidents occurred in the this area. Criminals often use spotters at highway checkpoints and bus stations to identify potential victims. While criminals mainly steal valuables, they may physically harm victims during the course of a robbery. Exercise caution when traveling along the northern areas of the country near the Mali and Niger borders. The Government of Burkina Faso and the U.S. Embassy have limited ability to provide assistance in the Sahel Reserve region. The U.S. Embassy has placed restrictions on official government travel to Dori, Djibo, the east-west road that connects these cities, and all areas north of that road. U.S. citizens are encouraged to follow the same guidance.   See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 10-10 and contact the U.S. Embassy. The national emergency telephone number, 10-10, will connect a caller to the Ministry of Security who can then dispatch the appropriate law enforcement or emergency assistance entity.  Within Ouagadougou, emergency services numbers are as follows: Fire Department: Dial 18 for emergencies. Dial 25-30-69-47 or 25-30-69-48 for administrative issues. Ambulance Service: Dial 18 for emergencies. Dial 25-30-66-44 or 25-30-66-45 for administrative issues. Police: Dial 17 or 25-30-63-83, or 25-30-71-00 for emergencies. Dial 25-36-44-42 or 25-32-60-69 for administrative issues. Gendarmerie (Military Police): Dial 16 or 25-30-62-71 for emergencies. Dial 25-30-32-71 or 25-31-33-40 for administrative issues.

    "Safety and Security": "Messages regarding security-related events are posted on the Embassy\u2019s website. Fighting between the Burma\u2019s military forces and ethnic armed groups and militia forces continues in border regions, including parts of Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Shan, Rakhine, and Chin States, and as well as in Sagaing and Magway in the center of the country. Travelers should avoid travel to these areas. The destinations frequented by most U.S. citizen visitors, including Rangoon, Bagan, Ngapali Beach, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay, are not currently affected by this fighting, but the security situation can change quickly. See our Travel Advisory for more information. Land mines and unexploded ordnance: Conflict-affected areas are of greatest concern, particularly areas of Shan, Chin, and Kachin States. The location of landmines is often not marked or otherwise identifiable. The regime\u2019s Ministry of Hotels and Tourism publishes information on restricted areas. Due to travel restrictions placed on U.S. diplomats by the de-facto authorities, our ability to assist U.S. citizens affected by incidents in remote and/or conflict-affected areas of Burma may be limited. Crime: Crime rates in Burma, especially involving foreigners, are lower than those of many other countries in the region. Nevertheless, the crime rate has been increasing, particularly home burglaries and petty crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare, but there have been incidents involving attacks by taxi drivers and muggings. Citizens are advised to take particular care when taking taxis late at night. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for more information.   Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 199 or in person at the police station in the district where the crime took place; and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(95) (1) 7536-509, ext. 4240, Emergency After-Hours Telephone: +(95) 1 7536-509.

In addition, intense rainfall and squalls may occur during the rainy season (approximately June to October annually). Travelers are encouraged to prepare for cyclone emergencies and monitor local news stations when cyclones are forecast. The Myanmar Department of Meteorology and Hydrology has a color-coded system for storm systems: red for storms approaching landfall in Burma, orange for storms moving towards Burma, yellow for developing storms, and brown for current storms. Additional information on storm preparedness may be found on our Crisis and Disaster Abroad webpage. Earthquakes do occur throughout Burma. Check here for information about earthquake preparedness. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s page has numerous resources on emergency kits, preparing for disasters and developing emergency plans: https://www.ready.gov/. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.

    "country_name": "Burundi",
    "Safety and Security": "See the Department of State\u2019s Travel Advisory for Burundi. Incidents of violence occur. Grenades and small arms have been used in some acts of violence in Burundi. Armed groups opposed to the Burundian government operate in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and have in the past launched attacks inside Burundian territory. DRC armed forces and UN peacekeepers continue to conduct combat operations against rebels, militia, and ISIS-aligned groups in Eastern DRC. As a result, Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, and the portion of Bujumbura Rural province that borders DRC, are vulnerable to armed violence. Armed actors may also exploit porous borders and forested areas between Burundi and Rwanda and the DRC for illicit activities. U.S. Embassy personnel follow increased security protocols when visiting the following areas: the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke, and Kibira National Park (including the park\u2019s southernmost part in Muramvya province), even when just transiting through the park to reach Kayanza via RN-10. Searches: Security forces routinely search vehicles and homes, including those of foreigners and U.S. citizens. Residential searches are routine and generally occur between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.; police must present identification and a warrant. Report improper searches to the U.S. Embassy. Roadblocks: Police maintain checkpoints throughout the country. Travelers have reported harassment, bribe solicitations, intimidation, and (though rare) physical violence, especially during heightened security situations. If stopped: Be compliant, calm, and courteous. Identify yourself as a U.S. citizen. Remain in your vehicle. Provide copies of identification documents if requested and attempt to keep originals. It is common practice for police to retain personal or vehicle identification documents in return for a ticket to ensure payment. Documents are returned following payment of the fine at Emmaus Pathway on Blvd Mwanbutsa or at other approved locations. Do not drive away until instructed to do so. Report harassment to the U.S. Embassy. Crime: Crimes of opportunity (mainly for financial gain) are the most reported incidents of crime against U.S. citizens in Burundi. In recent years, there have been two incidents of violent crime against U.S. citizens. Most criminal incidents involve theft, burglary, and robbery. Petty crime may be more likely in public places. Criminal elements do not typically single out U.S. citizens, but may view them as targets of opportunity based on perceived affluence or vulnerability. U.S. citizens should take these precautions: Keep doors and windows closed and locked (at home and in vehicles). If threatened, particularly by an armed assailant, do not refuse or resist\u2014your life is worth more than your belongings. Prior to your departure, tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back. Avoid being out alone late at night. Exercise caution when carrying and/or displaying possessions, especially valuable ones. Demonstrations occur occasionally. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Precautions: Carry original and color photocopies of your U.S. passport and visa at all times. Avoid large public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can turn violent. Be vigilant against petty crime. Monitor news and consular alerts.

    "country_name": "Cabo Verde",
    "Safety and Security": "Exercise extreme caution when participating in water sports, such as swimming, boating, and fishing, as the tides and currents around the islands are very strong. Several small fishing boats have been lost at sea, and drownings have occurred on the beaches and along the coast in Santiago, Sal, and on other islands.  The entire island of Fogo is an active volcano. Future eruptions remain a threat, as do earth tremors throughout the islands, especially on Fogo, Brava, and Santo Ant\u00e3o, and beneath the ocean channels that separate them. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available\u202fon our website. Crime:\u202f Petty crime and burglary are common in Cabo Verde, especially at marketplaces, festivals, street fairs, and public gatherings. Criminals target anyone perceived to be affluent, regardless of nationality. Avoid groups of children who appear to have no adult supervision, since the perpetrators of petty theft and pickpocketing are often groups of street children. Muggings occur often, particularly at night and in more isolated areas, and often involve violence. The perpetrators are predominantly males between the ages of 14 and 25 operating in groups of two or more. Due to inadequate lighting in many public areas, you should be especially vigilant after dark, carry a flashlight to illuminate your path, and never go out alone. You should also keep vehicle doors and windows locked and avoid isolated places.  It is dangerous to use hillside stairways connecting neighborhoods in Praia and many other Cabo Verdean cities and towns, even in broad daylight. These stairways isolate users and make them vulnerable to assault.  International Financial Scams:  See the\u202fDepartment of State\u202fand the\u202fFBI\u202fpages for information.  Victims of Crime:\u202f U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

    "country_name": "Cambodia",
    "Safety and Security": "The Department of State is concerned that individuals and groups may be planning terrorist actions against U.S. citizens and interests, including at sites frequented by Westerners in Southeast Asia. Extremist groups in Southeast Asia have transnational capabilities to carry out attacks against locations where Westerners congregate. Although the extremist threat in Cambodia is considered low and terrorist attacks are not common, U.S. citizens residing in, or traveling to, Cambodia should exercise caution in clubs, discos, bars, restaurants, hotels, places of worship, schools, outdoor recreation venues, tourist areas, beach resorts, and other places frequented by foreigners. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant with regard to their personal security and avoid ongoing police enforcement actions, crowds, and demonstrations. See Department of State\u2019s\u202fWorldwide Caution. Land mines and unexploded ordnance are found in remote rural areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Kampong Thom, and Oddar Meanchey provinces. Travelers in these regions should never walk in forested areas or even in dry rice paddies without a local guide. Areas around small bridges on secondary roads are particularly dangerous. Travelers should not touch anything that resembles a mine or unexploded ordnance; they should notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437. Crime:\u202fCambodia has a critical crime rate, including street crime. Military weapons and explosives are readily available to criminals despite authorities\u2019 efforts to collect and destroy such weapons. Armed robberies occur frequently, and foreign residents and visitors, including U.S. citizens, are among the victims. The Embassy has also received reports that residences and hotel rooms of U.S. citizens in Phnom Penh were burglarized while the occupants were asleep. The most common type of theft is \u201csnatch and grab\u201d robbery, and anything that can be quickly grabbed is at risk: cameras, jewelry, purses, backpacks, mobile phones, etc. Exercise caution and keep belongings out of sight if you travel via \u201ctuk-tuk,\u201d as passengers in these open-air vehicles have been targeted by thieves. If walking along the street, make yourself less of a target by carrying bags or items in your hand or on the shoulder that is furthest from the street. If someone attempts to rob you, you should surrender your valuables immediately, since any perceived resistance may be met with physical violence, including lethal force. The U.S. Embassy has received reports of violent robberies escalating into fatalities.  Pickpockets, some who are masquerading as beggars, are present in the markets and at the tourist sites. Sometimes they may act overly friendly, placing their hand on your shoulder or back to distract you in order to pick your pocket. To avoid the risk of theft or confiscation of original documents, the U.S. Embassy advises its personnel and all U.S. citizens traveling to, or residing in, Cambodia to carry photocopies of their U.S. passport, driver's license, and other important documents and to leave the originals in a hotel safe or other secure place. The U.S. Embassy advises citizens not to give their passport as collateral for motorcycle rentals, hotels, etc. Local police rarely investigate reports of crime against tourists, and travelers should not expect to recover stolen items. It has also been reported that some police stations charge foreigners between $20 and $100 to file a police report. Foreigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of common scams targeting tourists, often\u202finvolving card games. [MWP(P1] The Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens being approached by individuals in public locations, such as popular shopping malls, and being invited to their homes where they end up participating in card games. These are often scams to steal tourists\u2019 money. If you find yourself a victim of one of these scams, you should contact the U.S. Embassy. Foreigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of crime targeting tourists involving drugged drinks. The Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens\u2019 drinks being drugged at bars in order to incapacitate them for theft or sexual assault. Do not accept drinks from strangers and do not leave drinks unattended. The U.S. Embassy advises citizens to be wary of scams involving individuals claiming they are in Cambodia and need financial assistance from the United States. The Embassy has determined that many of these requests are fraudulent and the individuals making the requests use false identities. In the past year, numerous confirmed media reports of large-scale scam operations have led to a crackdown by Cambodian authorities. These operations have been reported to lure non-Cambodians with false promises of gainful employment. Victims of this false recruitment have then been made to participate in the online/phone-based financial confidence scams.  See the\u202fDepartment of State\u202fand the\u202fFBI pages for information on scams. There have been numerous reports of visitors receiving fake or novelty $50 and $100 bills from ATM machines and banks across Cambodia. When receiving money from ATMs or bank tellers, you should count and examine the money while still in the presence of the ATM camera or bank teller. The fake money typically has a different feel than real U.S. currency and often has markings on the lower left that indicate it is for novelty purposes. If a suspicious bill is discovered, it should be shown to the ATM camera or teller, and the bank should be notified immediately. The U.S. Embassy advises its personnel who travel to the provinces outside of Phnom Penh to exercise caution outside the provincial towns at all times. Many rural parts of the country remain without effective policing. Avoid walking alone after dusk anywhere in Sihanoukville, especially along the waterfront. You should be particularly vigilant during annual festivals and at tourist sites in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville, where there have been marked increases in motorcycle \u201csnatch and grab\u201d thefts of bags and purses. If you are visiting Cambodia, you should practice sound personal security awareness by varying your routes and routines, maintaining a low profile, not carrying or displaying large amounts of cash, not wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, and not walking alone after dark. In addition, you should travel by automobile and not use local moto-taxis or cyclos (passenger-carrying bicycles). These vehicles are more vulnerable to armed robberies and offer no protection against injury when involved in traffic accidents. U.S. citizens are advised not to engage in commercial surrogacy arrangements in Cambodia. In October 2016, the Government of Cambodia issued an official proclamation banning commercial surrogacy in Cambodia. Please keep in mind that U.S. citizens and other foreigners in Cambodia are subject to Cambodian laws and procedures. Although gambling and casinos are legal in Cambodia, the U.S. Embassy strongly encourages all travelers to be cautious in choosing to visit casinos or related gambling centers in Cambodia. The U.S. Embassy is aware of numerous reported incidents at casinos throughout Cambodia. In the past year, these incidents such as fires at casinos resulting in multiple fatalities, violent assaults, murders, and suicides under suspicious circumstances have occurred. Victims of Crime:\u202fReport crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at 023-728-000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa are active in Far North, North, and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon. Suicide bombings have occurred in public places in and around urban areas resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Terrorist attacks are most common outside major towns, especially in the regions bordering Nigeria and Chad. Extremists have frequently target areas of congregation, particularly camps for refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). While most victims of terrorist attacks in Cameroon have been locals, violent extremist organizations may seek to target Westerners or conduct other high-profile operations. Kidnapping by terrorist organizations remains a concern. Refrain from traveling outside of cities or towns after dark and exercise caution when in the vicinity of potential targets. There is ongoing violence in Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Security force operations and attacks by armed militants regularly take place throughout these Regions including in major cities. Neighboring areas of other regions are at risk of spillover violence, including Douala. Use of improvised explosives and incendiary devices, kidnappings, illegitimate detentions, and acts of violent criminality by armed actors have also occurred in Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Security forces, government officials, road travelers, administrative buildings, schools, and commercial areas have been repeatedly attacked. Those suspected of being associated, even tangentially, with the central government or armed militants have been targeted for reprisals by a variety of elements. Border Areas: Cameroon\u2019s borders remain porous. Terrorists regularly cross the border into Cameroon from Nigeria and Chad to conduct attacks in the Far North, North, and Adamawa Regions. Militant activities and security operations routinely occur along Cameroon\u2019s shared border with Nigeria in the Northwest and Southwest Regions. Armed criminals and communal militia frequently conduct attacks in border areas abutting the Central African Republic (CAR). Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to the Northwest, Southwest, North, and Far North Regions of Cameroon, as well as within 20 kilometers of the border with the Central African Republic in Adamawa and East Regions, and within 20 kilometers of the border with Nigeria and north of Ngaoudere in the Adamawa Region. Bakassi Peninsula: Cameroon's military authorities restrict access to the Bakassi Peninsula. U.S. citizens should avoid this area. Use of Improvised Explosive Devices: Multiple improvised explosive device (IED) attacks have occurred in Douala and Yaound\u00e9 since June 2020. The threat for similar attacks could take place countrywide. Various armed actors, to include terrorists and political militants, may use such devices. To date, recent IED incidents have not directly targeted U.S. citizens or areas frequented by Westerners, however the risk of wrong place/wrong time violence remains. Locations with a high security force or government presence may be at increased risk of being targeted. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Violent and opportunistic crime is prevalent throughout the country including major cities. Foreigners in Cameroon have been victims of all types of crime including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, carjacking, burglary, theft, armed robbery, and home invasion. Criminals often employ violence, particularly in instances where victims attempt to resist. The risk of street and residential crime is especially high, even in affluent areas with a large police and private security presence. Transport Crimes: U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from using taxis. Violent assaults on taxi passengers are common. Petty theft is prevalent, particularly on trains, buses, and taxis. The Hilton and Mont Febe hotels offer a shuttle service from Yaound\u00e9-Nsimalen Airport to downtown Yaound\u00e9. Travelers are encouraged to use this service or retain the services of a reputable private transport company. Avoid walking alone especially after dark. Do not display cash and valuables. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Maritime Security: Piracy and armed robbery continue to increase throughout the Gulf of Guinea including Cameroon\u2019s waters. Pirates and armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship\u2019s property are common and may occur near coastal areas or deep waters. More information on current conditions may be found on the Office of Naval Intelligence\u2019s piracy page. Communications: During periods of heightened unrest or insecurity, there is a heightened risk of communications disruptions which may affect internet access, social media, mobile messaging, and cellular voice calls. These disruptions may be localized or countrywide. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Cameroon. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/online dating Financial transactions/money transfers Too good to be true purchases or sales Contracts with promises of large commissions Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by calling 117 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (237) 22220-1500. Dial + (237) 22222-2525 in Yaound\u00e9 or dial 112 in major cities to contact ambulance services. If you have been a victim of sexual assault or rape, consider contacting a medical provider for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis.

Victims of Crime: Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in Douala and Yaound\u00e9. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of these two cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance."

    "Safety and Security": "Demonstrations occur frequently, especially on March 29, May 1 and 21, September 11, and October 18. Although most are peaceful, they can become violent. Avoid demonstrations if possible. Strikes are also common and can cause significant travel delays, especially if you are traveling to remote areas, such as Easter Island, Punta Arenas, or Chiloe. Anarchist groups have placed explosive and incendiary devices in public spaces throughout Santiago, such as ATMs, metro stations, and government facilities. Remain vigilant and avoid suspicious or unattended packages. Araucan\u00eda Conflict: Some individuals or groups claiming affiliation with the Mapuche indigenous community have sought redress for grievances by burning churches, homes, and pastures, and attacking trucks, buses, and farming/logging equipment, causing property destruction, injuries, and deaths. In 2022, the Government of Chile implemented a State of Emergency in the area that is reevaluated every 15 days. While these groups have mainly targeted forestry corporations and landowners, you should exercise caution in the Araucan\u00eda region. Crime: Street crime, carjackings, telephone scams, credit card fraud, and residential break-ins are common, especially in Santiago, Valparaiso, Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Antofagasta, Calama, and Iquique.

Cell phones are often stolen from restaurant tables. Criminals have drugged and robbed U.S. citizens, leaving them with no memory of events. The murder of a U.S. citizen occurred in 2023 in the neighborhood of Yungay. Carjackings and vehicle thefts are a serious problem in Santiago, Valparaiso, and northern Chile (from Iquique to Arica). Thieves have punctured rental car tires to distract foreigners and steal their belongings from the vehicle. Additionally, though not typical touring areas, exercise significant caution when traveling through or in Villa Francia, El Castillo, La Victoria, La Pincoya, Bajos de Mena y Mahuidanche, and the municipalities of Cerro Navia, Pudahuel, Quilicura and San Bernardo in Santiago, In particular: Keep all valuables on you when taking buses, especially to or from Calama and San Pedro de Atacama.

    "Safety and Security": "For most visitors, the PRC remains a very safe country. Traffic accidents are the most common safety concern for U.S. citizens. Training, capability, and responsiveness of PRC authorities vary by region and even by city. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General have no law enforcement authority and may not represent U.S. citizens in either criminal or civil legal matters. To ensure your safety and security in the PRC, you should: Take routine safety precautions. Pay attention to surroundings. Report any concerns to the local police. Call \u201c110,\u201d the local equivalent to \u201c911\u201d. English services are often available, but you should not expect English services in remote parts of the PRC. Violent crime is not common in the PRC, however: While sanctioned demonstrations must be approved by PRC authorities, they can turn violent. Domestic unrest and terrorism can occur. Business disputes between U.S. citizens and PRC-national business partners can sometimes result in physical confrontation, detainment, or coercion. Go straight to the police if you feel threatened or relocate to a public place. Be alert to criminal schemes, such as: \u201cTourist Tea\u201d Scams: PRC nationals invite visitors out to tea and leave them with an exorbitant bill. Phone Scams: Callers pose as police officers and request a funds transfer to resolve an identity theft or money laundering investigation. In these cases, DO NOT WIRE any money. If you receive any suspicious calls or requests, contact the local Public Security Bureau to verify the caller\u2019s identity. \u201cUnlicensed or Unapproved Cabs\u201d: Taxi and ridesharing services in China are generally licensed by authorities. Be cautious when using taxi or ridesharing services that are not accessible through mobile applications. If you use the locally approved taxi service, insist that the driver use the meter, and get a receipt. Have the name of your destination written in Chinese characters and ask the driver to remove the bags from the trunk before you get out of the taxi and before you pay. Counterfeit Currency: Although counterfeit currency has been a concern in the PRC the past, making purchases in cash is increasingly less common as most vendors prefer payments through local mobile payment apps. When you need cash, use only ATMs at trusted financial institutions, and carry a variety of denominations as vendors may have limited cash on hand as change. Be alert to criminal schemes, such as internet, phone scams, dating scams, as well as financial scams. If you already have been victim of a scam, catalogue as many details as possible, including names, telephone and bank numbers, and email and IP addresses; file a police report, and inform the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General. See the U.S. Department of State's and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s pages for information on scams.  Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate General.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting events, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)  Terrorist groups and criminal organizations continue operating and carrying out attacks in Colombia.   For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Crimes and scams against tourists, and those perceived to be wealthy, are common and well-coordinated in urban areas, including in affluent neighborhoods. Firearms and knives are prevalent in Colombia and often used in muggings and robberies under the threat of violence. Drive-by motorcyclist snatchings of cell phones, bags, and valuables are extremely common. Victims are often identified well in advance of the robbery based on visible jewelry, high value wristwatches, and general attire while in public places such as shopping malls, restaurants, and airports.   Narco-trafficking groups, including the Clan del Golfo frequently engage in violence against civilians and security forces.  Dating App Robberies/Drugging/Homicides: Criminals use dating apps to lure victims to meet in places such as hotels, restaurants, and bars, and then later assault and rob them. Numerous U.S. citizens in Colombia have been drugged, robbed, and even killed by their Colombian dates. You should be cautious if using dating apps in Colombia. If meeting with a stranger, you should strongly consider meeting only in public places and avoiding isolated locations, such as residences or hotel rooms, where crimes are most likely to occur. Tell a friend or family member of your plans, including where you are going, details of the person you are meeting, and the app you used to meet them. ATMs: There have been instances of fraudulent charges or withdrawals from accounts due to \u201cskimmed\u201d cards. If you choose to use credit or debit cards, you should regularly check your account to ensure there are no unauthorized transactions. Travelers should limit the amount of cash they carry in public, exercise caution when withdrawing cash from ATMs, and avoid ATMs located on the street. ATMs inside shopping malls or other protected locations are preferable.  Taxis: U.S. government employees are prohibited from hailing taxis on the street due to the risk of assault or robbery. U.S. citizens have been killed during robberies while using taxis. Use a dispatch service or cell phone app whenever possible. Disabling Drugs: The Embassy receives regular reports of criminals using drugs to temporarily incapacitate unsuspecting victims and then rob or assault them. Scopolamine, a fast-acting incapacitating drug, is often surreptitiously applied to food, drinks, and hand sanitizer vials by criminals to rob or assault their victims. Victims of scopolamine-related crimes are often targeted in bars, night clubs, or through dating apps. Avoid leaving food or drinks unattended at a bar or restaurant, and refuse offers of something to eat or drink from a stranger. Ayahuasca/Hallucinogens: Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca, can be marketed to tourists as \u201cspiritual cleansing,\u201d and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong psychedelic that is illegal in the United States and many other countries. Risks to hallucinogen users while intoxicated include robbery, assault, illness, or death. People claiming to be shamans or spiritual practitioners are neither licensed nor regulated. Demonstrations: Protests and demonstrations occur frequently, particularly in Bogota. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Colombia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by the government or by recognized authorities. In the event of an injury, adequate medical treatment may only be available in or near major cities. First responders may only be able to provide basic medical treatment and may be unable to access areas outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. Venezuelan Border: The U.S. Department of State has categorized Venezuela as Level 4: Do Not Travel due to crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping, and the arrest and detention of U.S. citizens without due process or fair trial guarantees. U.S. citizens are at risk of detention when crossing into Venezuela from Colombia. The Colombia-Venezuela border is not clearly marked, and U.S. citizens should not go near the border due to the risk of crossing into Venezuela accidentally and being detained for illegal entry. If you still choose to travel to Venezuela, do not attempt to enter Venezuela without a visa. Visas are not available upon arrival. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods. The Maduro regime does not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government is not granted access to those citizens. The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela."

Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while swimming. Tourism: The Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT) website maintains a list of Certified Tour Guides. You can also find valuable tourism safety and security information for Costa Rica in these English and Spanish language pamphlets provided by ICT. Adventure Sports:  Some tour operators take risks, and government regulation and oversight of firms that organize sporting activities may not always adhere to international standards and best practices. United States citizens have died in Costa Rica while participating in adventure sports. Use caution and common sense when engaging in ALL adventure sports, such as bungee jumping, sky diving, hiking, rappelling, climbing, whitewater rafting, kayaking, etc. Make sure your medical insurance covers your sport. See our section on Medical Insurance under \u201cHealth\u201d below. The Ministry of Health maintains a list of authorized Adventure Sports operators. Never participate in adventure sports alone. Always carry identification and let others know where you are at all times. Before kayaking and rafting, check river conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Even popular rafting locations such as the Rio Naranjo near Quepos can become extremely dangerous in flash flood conditions. When hiking, rappelling, or climbing, carry a first aid kit and know the location of the nearest rescue center. Observe all local or park regulations and exercise caution in unfamiliar surroundings. Domestic Violence: United States citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

Email: contactenos@ict.go.cr Potential for Natural Disasters: Costa Rica is in an active earthquake and volcanic zone.   Three volcanoes, two near San Jose and one in the northwest, have become more active in recent years. Ashfall due to volcanic eruptions from Turrialba can disrupt air traffic and cause or aggravate respiratory issues. Visitors should monitor and follow park service guidance and alerts regarding volcanic activity. Never attempt to climb or gain unauthorized access to an active volcano. Tsunamis may occur following significant earthquakes. Flooding occurs during the rainy season, typically from April until October, in the Caribbean Province of Limon and the Pacific Provinces of Puntarenas and Guanacaste. Flash floods and severe landslides occur in many parts of Costa Rica, depending on the time of year and rainfall. Do not drive into water of unknown depths. For information concerning disasters, see: U.S. Embassy Costa Rica website. The Embassy also sends out emergency information via e-mail, text, and/or Radio Dos (FM 99.5) or Radio Columbia (FM 98.7.) U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides general information about natural disaster preparedness  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides information regarding disease. U.S. Geological Survey provides updates on recent seismic and volcanic activity. Additional information regarding volcanic activity and other natural disasters in Costa Rica may be obtained from the following Spanish-language Costa Rican websites: Costa Rican National Emergency Commission Costa Rican Volcanic and Seismic Observatory Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Strikes may affect transportation, fuel supplies, and other public services. Local law prohibits foreigners from participating in public demonstrations, and violators may be subject to detention or deportation. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Hiking: When visiting national parks, abide by signage and stick to marked trails. First responders have limited ability to locate missing persons in remote areas. To hike in national parks, you must: Register with the park Obtain an entry permit Consider using a certified tour operator. The Costa Rican Tourist Institute (ICT) has contact information for Certified Tour Guides. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules are regularly enforced. Inspections take place on a regular basis; however, some lapses may occur in businesses that are not properly registered. Hazardous areas or activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is available but may be delayed due to road and traffic conditions as well as physical distances. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. United States citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance."

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.). Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists. Places of worship. Schools. Parks. Beaches. Shopping malls and markets. Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights). C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire remains under threat by extremist organizations in the region, including those active across the border in Burkina Faso and Mali, which have experienced increased terrorist activity. While C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is not considered a base of operations, extremists carried out an attack at an Ivoirian military border post in the town of Kafolo in June 2020. For more information, see our Terrorism page.  Crime: Crime continues to be a major public security concern in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Armed carjackings, robberies of businesses, and home invasions target residents, including expatriates, who are perceived as wealthy. U.S. citizens should exercise caution when visiting Abidjan\u2019s Abobo, Adjame, Angre, Koumassi, Marcory, and Yopougon districts, as well as popular neighborhoods for nighttime entertainment, including Plateau, Treichville, and Zone 4. Carry identification at all times to minimize the risk of harassment at police checkpoints. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has undertaken security sector reform actions, and, as a result, its national police and gendarmerie are in a transitional period. The military often performs what might be considered traditional civilian law enforcement functions for which it is not properly trained. Weapons left over after the civil war present a continuing security threat exploitable by criminals and rogue soldiers. Political factions and their supporters armed with these weapons pose an ongoing risk to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s fragile democratic institutions. For more information, please see C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s Travel Advisory. Demonstrations\u202foccur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Election-related violence is another concern; a presidential election took place on October 31, 2020, and legislative elections are expected to take place in early 2021. Several riots and demonstrations, sometimes resulting in deaths, have occurred, and may continue due to ongoing political tensions. For more information, please see C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s Travel Advisory. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Internet romance and financial scams are increasingly prevalent in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles, or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/relative targeting Free trip/luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

    "Safety and Security": "The security environment in Cuba is relatively stable and characterized by a strong military and police presence.  Demonstrations are infrequent but can draw violent responses from government forces.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational without warning.  Avoid demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Demonstration Alerts are posted on the Embassy\u2019s website.  Review the Cuba Travel Advisory. The Cuban government has detained U.S. citizens suspected of engaging in activities perceived to undermine state security.  The Cuban government may detain individuals for activities that would not be considered criminal or offensive in the United States. Crime:  With the recent influx of travelers, there has been an increase in the number of property crimes. Crimes of opportunity, such as pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins, are on the rise. Exercise vigilance everywhere. Do not display large amounts of cash.  Do not leave your valuables unattended.  Carry money in your front pockets, hold your purse and cellular phone securely and be mindful of purses or bags when dining out.  Do not leave a beverage unattended or accept beverages from persons unknown to you.  Locations such as Habana Vieja, Playas del Este, Varadero, and other attractions tend to have a higher incidence of property crime than other parts of Cuba.  Be wary of misdirection schemes where someone attempts to gain your attention while another comes from behind to steal your purse, wallet, or other valuable items.  If confronted by criminals, do not resist, try to remain calm, clearly display your hands and do not make any sudden moves that could be interpreted as resistance.  Carry a cell phone with Cuban cellular service for emergency communications and travel in groups if possible.  Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night or when traveling in an unfamiliar area.  While in your car, place valuables out of sight or in a locked trunk.  When unattended, avoid leaving items in the car, especially on the seat or in plain view. Only use marked taxis.  Carry a copy of your passport and secure the original.  Beware of scam artists, who may speak English and appear friendly.  When exchanging currency, use the state-run offices known as CADECAs or official banks.

    "country_name": "Cura\u00e7ao",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: Crimes of opportunity are common, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, particularly at beaches, hotel lobbies, or from cars. Be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to secure personal property. Car theft is an increasing problem. Do not leave valuables in cars in plain view or unattended in unsecured hotel rooms and rental homes. Parking lots that are unattended and without access control are considered higher risk for car break-ins. Some beaches charge a fee for access and employ private security, which provides some deterrent to crime.  Keep a copy of your valid U.S. passport in a secure location in case your passport is stolen. Violent crime, including rape and armed robbery \u2013 although not common \u2013 does occur. Exercise caution when visiting more isolated areas of the island. Some thefts and assaults have been reported near nature areas, remote beaches, and small or informal parking areas used by divers.   If you are traveling with children, be aware that the legal drinking age of 18 is not always enforced, so extra parental supervision may be appropriate.  Take standard precautions when frequenting nightclubs and bars. Travel in pairs or groups and, if you consume alcohol, do so responsibly.

Crime: The Czech Republic generally has little crime. However, you should still take precautions against becoming a victim of crime. Emergencies: dial 112 Police: dial 158 Firefighters and Rescue: dial 150 Emergency Medical Service: dial 155 Pickpocketing is problematic, especially in major tourist areas in Prague. Criminals operate in professional, highly organized groups and may be armed with simple weapons, so avoid direct confrontation. Do not leave your belongings unattended. High-risk areas include: public transportation, the city center, crowded areas and outdoor cafes. Victims of sexual assault report being drugged with rohypnol and other \u201cdate rape\u201d-type drugs. Use caution when accepting open drinks at bars or clubs, and do not leave drinks unattended. Pedestrian traffic violations, such as jaywalking, may be enforced in Prague\u2019s city center. Discretionary fines up to 2000 Czech crowns (about $100) may be applied. Refusal to pay may lead to a court procedure and an even higher fine. Streetcars have the right of way over pedestrians at crosswalks. Casinos and gaming establishments are government-regulated, but some have been affiliated with, or attracted the interest of, organized crime. Conduct currency exchanges at reputable banks or legitimate money kiosks. Pay close attention to the exact rate offered for the amount you wish to exchange, as rates may vary widely for smaller versus larger amounts and between different exchange offices. An offer to exchange currency by an unknown person on the street is most likely a scam. ATMs are widely available throughout major cities. Criminal organizations have used electronic \u201cskimming\u201d to steal card information and PIN numbers at some ATMs. Use ATMs at secure, monitored locations (commercial banks, large hotels, and the airport). Auto thefts and break-ins are common in the Czech Republic, especially in major cities. Use parking garages and anti-theft devices. Don\u2019t leave valuables in plain sight inside vehicles, as this significantly increases the possibility of theft. Overcharging scams: Verify charges paid with credit card are correct before signing for purchases, keep all receipts, and check your credit card accounts online to ensure correct billing. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

    "Safety and Security": "See the Department of State Travel Advisory and Alerts for the DRC. The security situation in most parts of eastern DRC remains unstable due to the activities of rebel and other armed groups and ongoing military operations. Armed groups, individuals, and military forces routinely clash with each other. Civilians are frequently targeted in attacks and other illegal activities, such as kidnapping, forced taxation, and forced labor.  Terrorist and armed groups operating in North Kivu and Ituri provinces have regularly attacked military and civilian targets and represent an ongoing threat to humanitarian aid workers and other NGO personnel operating in the area. Armed group violence has increased in parts of South Kivu. Sporadic but severe outbreaks of violence targeting civilians, including killing, rape, kidnapping, and pillaging, continue throughout North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, Haut Lomami, Bas-Uele, and Haut-Uele and three Kasai provinces of Kasai Oriental, Kasai Central, and Kasai Provinces.   Travelers in remote area of the country, especially in the eastern DRC, should travel with a minimum of two vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite phones. Road travelers are frequently targeted for ambush, armed robbery, and kidnapping.  Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.

Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Crimes of opportunity (mainly for financial gain) are the most reported incidents of crime against U.S. citizens in Kinshasa and throughout the DRC. Most incidents involve theft such as pickpocketing, burglary, and robbery. Petty crime may be more likely in public places and areas of congregation. Criminal elements do not typically single out U.S. citizens, but may view them as targets of opportunity based on perceived affluence or vulnerability. Roadblocks: Security forces set up spontaneous roadblocks, especially after dark, to conduct vehicle searches and check identity papers. They may also solicit bribes. Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate. Remain calm and, if threatened, do not resist. Demonstrations: Demonstrations and gatherings occur with increasing frequency and with little notice. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on significant holidays, and during international events. Police have at times responded to demonstrations with heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests. In the eastern DRC, demonstrations can rapidly become extrajudicial mobs and turn violent, posing a threat to humanitarian aid workers and other personnel operating in the area. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check U.S. Embassy messaging and local media for updates and advisories. Monitor consular Alerts and messages and local and international news from reliable sources. English-language news can be found on BBC at 92.6 FM. Radio Okapi broadcasts in French on 103.5 FM at 7:00 a.m., 8:00 a.m., 12:00 noon, and 6:00 p.m., and provides updates throughout the day. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Kidnapping for Ransom: The risk of kidnapping for ransom exists throughout the country, but is more common in eastern DRC. International humanitarian workers have been targeted. Reports of kidnapping of a U.S. citizen should be passed to the U.S. Embassy immediately. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at +243 81-555-5944 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +243 97 261- 6145. Dial 112 to contact the police in an emergency in Kinshasa. Remember local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion. Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are limited and are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance, especially given the current COVID-19 pandemic.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack - including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)  For more information, see our Terrorism page.  Crime: Organized crime groups operate in Denmark, including in and around Copenhagen. Travelers should be aware of their surroundings and immediately leave the area if they feel threatened. In response to crime, police may establish \u201cSearch Zones\u201d (\u201cvisitationszoner\u201d in Danish) and stop and search individuals.  Pickpockets and purse-snatchers operate aggressively in areas frequented by tourists, as well as on trains and buses, and at transit stations, including Copenhagen Central Station, Copenhagen Airport, and cruise ship quays. Do not place any bags containing valuables, such as your passport or credit cards, on the ground or on the back of a chair in public places, such as restaurants, bars, and cafes.  Watch your laptop and mobile devices, which are particularly desirable to thieves. U.S. citizens are encouraged to review the OSAC Crime and Safety Report for more information on crime in the Kingdom of Denmark. When traveling or living in the Kingdom of Denmark, you should: Be aware of the local security situation and take appropriate steps to bolster your personal security. Monitor media and local information sources, and factor updated information into personal travel plans and activities. Address specific safety concerns to Danish law enforcement authorities who have responsibility for the safety and security of all residents and visitors. Exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations. If stopped by the police, cooperate and be prepared to present identification. Freetown Christiania, located in the Christianshavn area of Copenhagen, is known for illicit drug activity. Drug enforcement efforts have resulted in clashes between the police and Christiania residents.  Christiania residents have imposed a strict no-photography policy; tourists have been assaulted and robbed for taking pictures. Police and emergency services are limited in Christiania. Demonstrations\u202foccur regularly in Denmark. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on holidays, or during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Bear in mind that large public gatherings can affect transportation arteries in the city. Monitor local media for updates and traffic advisories.  International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +45 3341-7100 or +45 3341-7400 for after-hours assistance. For non-life threatening situations, individuals in the greater Copenhagen area may dial 1813 to reach an urgent medical helpline. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

A police report must be filed within 72 hours. Local police or the Danish Criminal Injuries Compensation Board can provide the forms to file for compensation. Processing time can vary from one to three months to receive compensation. More information about compensation payments to victims of serious crime is available at the Compensation Board\u2019s website. If you are victim of crime in Greenland or the Faroe Islands, please contact the Embassy at +45 3341-7100 or +45 3341-7400 (after hours) for further assistance. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Domestic violence victims are also encouraged to file a police report with local law enforcement at 112. Tourism: The tourism industry is regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. This is especially true in Greenland \u2013 a semi-autonomous, self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland is vast and remote, and the weather can be unpredictable, making it especially difficult for first responders to access areas. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance."

For more information, see our Terrorism page. Civil unrest or armed conflict in the neighboring countries of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen, and Somalia may affect the security situation in Djibouti. Tensions along the Djibouti-Eritrea border exist from an ongoing border dispute, necessitating approval from the Djibouti government before travel north of Obock. Border skirmishes have occurred in the past. Many border areas between Djibouti and both Ethiopia and Somalia lack visible demarcation and may still contain landmines. Crime: Crimes of opportunity are most common and include pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from or of vehicles, and identity theft (by stealing credit card information). Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property. Avoid actions that would draw attention to yourself. Dress conservatively. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Travel with a copy of your U.S. passport and Djibouti visa to prevent the originals from being taken. Keep original documents in a secure location.

    "country_name": "Dominican Republic",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: Crime is a threat throughout the Dominican Republic. Tourist destinations are generally more policed than metropolitan areas. If robbed, hand over your personal belongings without resisting. Do not carry or wear valuable items that will attract attention. Be wary of strangers. Travel with a partner or group if possible. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Dating App Robberies: Several U.S. citizen travelers in the Dominican Republic have reported that they were robbed by people they met through popular online dating applications. If meeting with strangers, you should strongly consider meeting only in public places and avoiding isolated locations where crimes are most likely to occur. Demonstrations: Avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if you are in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local tourist police (POLITUR) at 809-222-2026 or 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 809-567-7775. 911 is operational throughout the country apart from some areas located near the Haitian border. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: Help you find appropriate medical care. Assist you in reporting a crime to the police. Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. Provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion. Provide a list of local attorneys.

Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact POLITUR (809-222-2026), the National Police (809-682-2151), and the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Sexual Assault: Rape and sexual assault has been reported throughout the Dominican Republic, including at major resorts and hotels. Notes for your safety: U.S. citizens have been targeted with date rape drugs. Sexual assault victims in the Dominican Republic should not expect the totality of assistance offered in the United States. Rape kits are often not available until the following morning and must be administered by Dominican authorities. Victims often have to request medication to avoid transmission of STDs and reduce the chances of pregnancy. Prosecution of a rape case moves forward very slowly. Dominican law may require the victim to return to the Dominican Republic at some stages of the judicial process. Security outside of the resort area, including beach areas, is unpredictable, especially at night. Best Practices: Contact the police/hotel management if resort staff demonstrate unwanted attention. Victims of sexual/other assault should contact the police and the Embassy. Insist that hotel management take immediate action by contacting the police. In a resort, avoid secluded places. Always be accompanied by someone you know, even going to the restroom. Do not consume alcoholic beverages alone or with new acquaintances. Do not leave drinks unattended.  Know your limits and help your friends/travelling companions to remain safe. Shout for help immediately if threatened or made uncomfortable. Report suspicious activity, including excessive friendliness by hotel employees, to hotel management, the U.S. Embassy, and local police. Do not swim alone due to life-threatening undertows. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not commonly occur in all parts of the country. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities or major tourist zones. First responders may be unable to access areas outside of major cities or major tourist zones. The ability to provide urgent medical treatment may be limited.

    "country_name": "Ecuador",
    "Safety and Security": "Exercise increased caution when traveling in Ecuador, and do not travel to the province of Carchi, the province of Sucumb\u00edos, and the northern part of Esmeraldas province, including Esmeraldas city due to crime. U.S. government personnel may travel to the northern bank of the Napo River in Sucumb\u00edos, where tourist lodges are located, an area approximately four miles wide, and to the portion of Esmeraldas province that is south of Esmeraldas city. All other U.S. government travel to the northern border area is prohibited without prior permission. This region has a high rate of violent crime. U.S. citizens are not targeted, but have been victims of crime there in the past. Crime: Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador. Pick-pocketing, robbery, and hotel room theft are the most common crimes. Tourists have been robbed at gunpoint on beaches and along hiking trails. Passengers arriving at the Quito and Guayaquil airports have also been targets of armed robberies. Use hotel safes if available, avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or clothing, and carry only the cash or credit cards that you need. Stay alert in crowds and on public transportation. Be aware that thieves might create distractions to target you. Be alert for robberies, in which criminals enter a taxi and force victims to withdraw money from ATMs. Some victims have been beaten or raped. Avoid hailing taxis on the street. Order taxis by phone or use a service affiliated with major hotels. Avoid withdrawing large amounts of cash at one time. Use ATMs in well-protected indoor areas. To avoid carjacking or theft from your car while you are stopped at intersections, drive with your doors locked and windows rolled up. Do not leave valuables in plain view. Sexual assaults and rapes can occur, even in tourist areas. Travel in groups, do not leave food or drinks unattended, and never allow a stranger to give you a drink. Do not let your credit card out of your sight in order to avoid credit card \u201cskimming.\u201d Incapacitating drugs, such as rohypnol and scopolamine, have been used to facilitate violent robberies and sexual assaults. Civil Unrest: Demonstrations may occur occasionally. They may take place in response to local or international events or on politically significant holidays. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Protesters may block roads and sometimes burn tires, throw rocks, and damage property. Police may respond using water cannons and tear gas. Avoid demonstrations and prepare back-up transportation plans. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent with little or no warning. A disaster can disrupt food supply, so plan to have at least a 3-day supply of food and medicine on hand. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Quito or Consulate in Guayaquil for assistance.

    "country_name": "Egypt",
    "Safety and Security": "The Department of State Travel Advisory warns U.S. citizens to avoid travel to the Sinai Peninsula (with the exception of travel to Sharm El-Sheikh by air) and the Western Desert. Travel to the Libyan and Sudanese borders is also not recommended. U.S. citizens in Egypt should maintain a high level of vigilance throughout the country due to the threat of terrorism. Between December 2018 and May 2019, terrorist incidents in tourist areas in greater Cairo killed four tourists and wounded at least 18 others. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, western businesses, resorts, and local government facilities. There is a possibility of terrorist attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security presence. In August 2019, a car bomb explosion outside of a hospital in Cairo killed at least 20. Additionally, terrorists have targeted religious sites, to include mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations. The Egyptian government has attempted to address security concerns and has visibly augmented its security presence at tourist locations, but challenges persist, and the threat of terrorism remains. Police and military are also engaged in operations to combat terrorism and disrupt terrorist cells in the Sinai Peninsula and the Nile Valley. Do not travel to: The Sinai Peninsula (with the exception of travel to Sharm El-Sheikh by air) due to terrorism. The Sinai Peninsula remains a particularly dangerous area, with frequent terrorist attacks on security forces and civilians. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens anywhere in the Sinai Peninsula as U.S. government employees are not authorized to travel to these areas (with the exception of the beach resort of Sharm El-Sheikh; travel to Sharm El-Sheikh is only permitted by air). The Western Desert due to terrorism. Egyptian border areas other than official ports of entry. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Egypt\u2019s borders are under military control; movement of non-military persons and vehicles is substantially restricted, and in some cases prohibited, within these areas. U.S. citizens should not travel in these border zones. It is illegal to photograph police stations, military barracks, and certain other sensitive public buildings. U.S. citizens are urged to remain alert to local security developments, avoid demonstrations, and be vigilant regarding their personal security at all times throughout the country. U.S. citizens should also carry identification and a cell phone or other means of communication that works in Egypt, and it is advisable to pre-program the U.S. Embassy\u2019s telephone number (+20 2 2797-3300) and email address (ConsularCairoACS@state.gov) into the device. Travelers must obtain permission and a travel route from the Egyptian Military Intelligence and the Tourist Police Headquarters via a local or overseas travel agency to access Egypt's frontiers, including the borders with Libya, Sudan, Israel, and parts of the Sinai Peninsula off paved roads. High concentrations of World War II-era unexploded landmines are located in the World War II battlefields along the Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria, the Eastern Desert between Cairo and the Suez Canal, and much of the Sinai Peninsula. Travelers are urged to be especially cautious in these areas. Crime: Crime levels in Cairo and Alexandria are moderate. The vast majority of criminal acts against foreigners are crimes of opportunity, such as purse snatching and pickpocketing.  Harassment of women, including foreigners, remains a serious problem. Incidents of harassment range from lewd comments and gestures to indecent exposure and inappropriate physical contact. Tourists should be alert to being overcharged for various services and for being victimized in scams common to tourist destinations worldwide. Tourists should expect to encounter aggressive vendors at Egypt\u2019s shops in urban areas, as well as at the many temples and archaeological sites. Some will offer \u201cfree\u201d gifts to tourists which, once accepted, lead to demands for money. Most sites have specially designated tourist police who can assist in uncomfortable situations. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Egypt. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers The U.S. Embassy receives frequent reports of online financial scams, often involving a fraudulent romantic partner requesting money for hospital bills or legal expenses to depart Egypt. Be skeptical about sending money to anyone known only through online contact. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 122 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(20) 2-2797-3300. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. The Embassy cannot intervene in legal disputes. Failure to report crimes before leaving Egypt will make it impossible to seek prosecution at a later date. U.S. citizen tourists can forward their complaints for investigation to the Tourist Police Headquarters. For crimes involving children, you may call Egypt\u2019s Child Emergency Help line by dialing 16000. Egypt\u2019s National Council for Women provides some assistance to women who are victims of domestic violence, or other complaints, at phone number 15115 or website: http://www.oo-ncw.org.

    "country_name": "El Salvador",
    "Safety and Security": "The crime threat level in El Salvador is critical and our Travel Advisory warns U.S. citizens of the high rates of crime and violence. See below for additional information on crime. Dial 911 for emergency assistance in El Salvador. Protests: Demonstrations, sit-ins, and protests may occur at any time or place, but are most frequent in and around the capital San Salvador. Avoid demonstrations, because even apparently peaceful ones may turn violent. Follow local news media reports or contact the U.S. Embassy for up-to-date information. Crime: El Salvador has a high level of homicides and crimes such as extortion, assault, and robbery are common. Typical crimes in El Salvador include extortion, mugging, highway assault, home invasion, and car theft. Gangs have traditionally controlled a majority of the space in El Salvador, even if their presence is not visible to outsiders, and exist by extorting money from businesses, travelers, residents and others living in or passing through their territory. Non-compliance or resistance to gang demands often results in violence. This activity can occur even in wealthy and relatively peaceful areas. Home invasions and/or burglaries of residences during broad daylight occur in areas of San Salvador; in some cases, gangs simply expel residents from their homes and take over the property for criminal use.  U.S. citizens who visit El Salvador for extended periods may be at higher risk for extortion demands. El Salvador has tens of thousands of known gang members from several gangs including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street (M18). Gang members have been known to frequently engage in violence or use deadly force if resisted. The gangs, or \u201cmaras,\u201d customarily have concentrated on extortion, violent street crime, carjacking, narcotics and arms trafficking, and murder for hire.  Extortion is a common crime in El Salvador. Many suspected gang members have been detained since March 27, 2022 under a State of Exception.  Reported crimes have reduced since that time, but crime in El Salvador remains at critical levels. U.S. Embassy personnel are advised to walk only in known, lit, well-secured locations. Criminals may be active even in popular parks with a security presence. Exercise caution at all times and practice good personal security procedures throughout your stay. Always travel in groups. Avoid remote or isolated locations. Avoid displaying or carrying valuables in public places. Avoid stopping at tourist overlooks, which may be targeted by criminals. Never leave passports and other important documents in vehicles. In public, remain alert and avoid the use of cell phones and earphones. These reduce your self-awareness and provide easy targets for crimes of opportunity. Do not travel on public transportation, especially buses. Use only radio-dispatched taxis, taxis stationed in front of major hotels, or internet-based rideshare services. Choose banks or ATMs inside secure, guarded areas and remain alert. Remain vigilant even in well-known restaurants, hotels, and retailers within San Salvador. Credit card cloning and similar fraud can occur; keep your card in sight. Be aware of your surroundings when traveling by car. Navigation apps seeking the quickest routes may direct you off safer routes into dangerous areas. Drive with your doors locked and windows raised. Avoid travel outside of major metropolitan areas after dark and on unpaved roads at all times because of hazardous road conditions and criminal activity. Criminals who threaten violence typically use violence without hesitation if victims do not comply instantly. Conversely, the Embassy has no reports of serious injury or worse among victims who comply. Armed robberies of climbers and hikers in El Salvador\u2019s national parks can occur. Engage the services of a local guide certified by the national or local tourist authority when hiking in back-country areas and within the national parks. The tourist police force (POLITUR)  provides security and assistance to tourists. Officers are located in 19 tourist destinations. Beware of hikes and guides in locations without an official guide service or police presence, regardless of advice found on the Internet.  A majority of serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved. The Government of El Salvador lacks sufficient resources to properly investigate and prosecute cases and to deter violent crime.  Do not purchase counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are counterfeit goods subject to seizure upon entry in the United States, but if you purchase them, you may also be exposed to legal liability in El Salvador. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes a victim of crime, report it to the local police by calling 911 and to the U.S. Embassy. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. The U.S. Embassy can: Replace a stolen or lost passport Help you find appropriate medical care Guide you on how to report a crime to police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms Provide a list of local attorneys Provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, call 911. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  Watersports: Strong undertows and currents make swimming at El Salvador's Pacific Coast beaches extremely dangerous even for experienced swimmers. Government lifeguards are generally present at most public beaches but are not always present at private beaches. Follow all instructions of any lifeguard, and do not enter the water at any location at which red warning flags are displayed to signify dangerous conditions. In addition, El Salvador\u2019s search and rescue capabilities are limited, and access to medical resources in beach areas is inadequate. Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities and consider your physical capabilities and skills. Be aware that drinking alcohol and swimming can be a deadly combination."

    "Safety and Security": "Crime: Though violent crime is rare, instances of violent burglaries/home invasions have occurred. Travelers have encountered anti-foreigner hostility from police and other officials, especially towards those of perceived Western or Chinese descent. Many situations, including petty or street crime and official harassment, have the potential to turn violent.  Security forces may stop people and request money. There has been a significant increase in attacks against women, including U.S. citizens, by small groups posing as taxi drivers and passengers. Victims typically are held captive for up to an hour, threatened at knifepoint, and robbed. Take taxis only in groups, use taxi drivers personally known to you, or avoid taxis altogether, especially in Bata. Be mindful of how much cash you have in your possession when entering a taxi and try to avoid carrying large sums of cash. Avoid dark alleys, remote locations, and traveling alone. Carry a copy of your passport and other pertinent documents at all times. Authorities may perceive notarized copies as more official than non-notarized copies. Political Violence: Demonstrations are not allowed, and therefore are rare. If you encounter a large gathering, avoid the area, as it is likely an illegal demonstration; the police will attempt to disperse the crowd, including through the use of force. Maritime Security: Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continues to increase. Pirates and armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship\u2019s property are common occurrences. Incidents may occur close to coastlines or in open seas. More information on current conditions may be found on the Office of Naval Intelligence\u2019s piracy page. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. It is common to be asked to pay between $50 to $100 in order to file a police report or obtain a copy of a police report on file. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

    "Safety and Security": "See the Department of State Travel Advisory for Eritrea. Eritrea experiences frequent water shortages and not all hotels have running water. Fuel shortages occur as well. Travel Permits: All foreign nationals, including U.S. Embassy officials, are required to obtain permits for travel more than 25 km outside of Asmara. Applications for travel permits are available at the two Ministry of Tourism offices located on Harnet Avenue and Airport Road. If you encounter difficulties while outside of the Asmara area, the Embassy\u2019s ability to provide consular services may be limited. Use caution when traveling near the Eritrea-Ethiopia border area. Remain on major roads in the border region due to unmarked minefields. The Eritrea-Ethiopia border is closed; there is no legal means to travel between Ethiopia and Eritrea by land. Foreign nationals generally are not permitted to approach or cross the Djibouti-Eritrea land border. There are landmines, particularly in Nakfa, AdiKeih, Arezza, the 25-mile-wide region (40 km) between the Setit and Mereb Rivers, and in areas north and west of Keren, areas near Massawa, Ghinda, Agordat, Barentu, Dekemhare, and south of Tessenae. Certain remote Eritrean islands have military facilities and are not accessible to tourists. Crime: The Embassy is unable to quantify actual rates of crime as Eritrea does not publicly provide crime statistics, but crimes do occur and police have limited capacity to investigate. While most reported criminal incidents in Asmara involve crimes of opportunity, car and home burglaries and sexual assaults are also reported. U.S. citizens are encouraged to implement personal security practices such as: Avoid walking alone, especially at night. Do not display cash and valuable personal property. Maintain a low profile. Avoid doing anything that draws attention to you or your family. Remain alert to what is going on around you.

    "country_name": "Estonia",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) The current Department of State Travel Advisory assesses Estonia at Level 1, indicating travelers should exercise normal precautions when coming to the country.  There is minimal risk from terrorism in Tallinn.  There are no known homegrown terrorist organizations in Estonia, which is not a known base of support/sympathy for terrorists. Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe.  European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks.  All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.  For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime:  There is minimal risk from crime in Estonia.  Pickpocketing, theft, and petty crime do occur, particularly in crowded areas and areas where tourists and foreigners congregate.  Pickpockets use various diversionary tactics to distract victims; one method involves bumping the victim in an effort to draw their attention to one individual, while another takes their wallet.  Victims should report the crime to the police and cancel their credit cards as soon as possible. The majority of incidents affecting U.S. citizens involve individuals who are alone and/or intoxicated at night.  Visitors who consume alcohol should exercise moderation and designate a sober member of the group to be in charge of security awareness.  Statistics indicate incidents against individuals based on race, religion, or sexual orientation/gender identity are limited; however the Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens being harassed due to their race. Demonstrations:  Large demonstrations occur infrequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable and U.S. citizens should exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams:  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Estonia.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(372) 668-8128.  Victims of crime may also call 116 006 to contact Estonia\u2019s Social Insurance Board\u2019s Victim Support and Prevention Services Department to speak to a victim support worker.  For social welfare emergencies, such as domestic violence or child abuse, dial 112 (English-speaking operators are sometimes available).

Many, but not all, operators speak English. Domestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism:  The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules [with regards to best practices and safety inspections] are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.

    "country_name": "Eswatini",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: While there are no specified concerns of terrorism for Eswatini, in general, terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists have increasingly used less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)  Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists  Places of worship  Schools  Parks  Shopping malls and markets  Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page Regional Power Outages (load shedding): Eswatini\u2019s ability to deliver power to the electrical grid may be inhibited by on-going regional load-shedding. Precautions should be taken to carry a flashlight or non-electric light source in event of a sustained loss of power. Demonstrations: Public protests, demonstrations, and strikes occur occasionally in Eswatini, mostly in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Armed law enforcement personnel have been known to use force to disrupt or control such events. During the course of such events, police may not distinguish between observers and protesters. You should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, so travelers should avoid areas near protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. CRIME: Crime is the most significant threat to U.S. citizens and incidents of petty crime and violent crime are prevalent throughout Eswatini. Criminals will resort to force, including deadly force, to accomplish their goal and are not deterred by confrontations with their intended victims. Carjackings may become violent if victims do not immediately cooperate. Take Precautions: Congested, urban areas are particularly dangerous at night. Exercise caution at all times. Do not to wear jewelry or carry expensive or unnecessary valuables in public. Do not display cell phones and large sums of cash. When using an ATM, always make sure to cover the screen as you enter your PIN, and have a plan in mind in the case that your card gets hacked. Convert currency at authorized currency exchanges; never with street vendors. Never store or leave items of value in your vehicle. Exercise caution when using local taxis. Ensure the taxi you use is from a reputable company. Never enter a taxi that is occupied by anyone besides the driver. Call a friend to let them know the plate number of the taxi you are using.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Al-Qa\u2019ida and its regional affiliate, Somalia-based al-Shabaab, maintain a presence throughout East Africa. In late 2020, Ethiopian security officials announced the arrest of al-Shabaab and ISIS members who were accused of planning attacks in Addis Ababa and other parts of Ethiopia. Current information indicates that terrorist organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and Western targets and interests in East Africa, as well as against high-profile targets within those countries that contribute troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia, including Ethiopia. Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)  Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists  Places of worship  Schools  Parks  Shopping malls and markets  Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Civil Unrest: Ethiopia has experienced sporadic and spontaneous civil unrest throughout the country, some of which has ended in violence. During such episodes, the Ethiopian government often curtails or limits mobile telecommunications, internet access, and social media. If this happens, you may be unable to contact family and friends or emergency services. The U.S. Embassy does not provide internet access to private individuals. U.S. government personnel must request permission for personal and official travel outside of Addis Ababa and are required to carry personnel tracking devices and, in some cases, satellite phones. U.S. government personnel may not take personal trips to: All national border regions of Ethiopia Gambella (except Gambella City) Benishangul Gumuz (except Assosa City) Some areas in western and southern parts of Oromia region Tigray region Amhara region U.S. government personnel may only travel to Gambella City and Assosa City by plane.  Western areas of Oromia: Wollega zones that include Kellem Wollega, West Wollega, Horro-Guduru Wollega and parts of East Wollega have reported civil unrest including fighting involving armed groups. Southern areas of Oromia: West Guji zone has reported civil unrest including fighting involving armed groups. Ethiopia\u2019s Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People\u2019s Region (SNNPR): Civil unrest in the region, particularly in Bench Sheko Zone and Konso Special Woreda, has resulted in deaths, looting, and the burning of buildings. Border with Kenya: There have been numerous incidents of inter-ethnic conflict reported near the border areas with Kenya, as well as attacks attributed to the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA or OLF-Shane). Criminal activity in this border area remains a concern. Tigray and Border with Eritrea: Due to conflict in the region, Tigray and the border with Eritrea are currently off-limits for U.S. government personnel. Due to the current situation in Tigray, the border roads with Eritrea are closed. Conditions at the border may change with no warning. Border with South Sudan (Gambella Region): The security situation in the region is volatile. Sporadic inter-ethnic clashes are common along the western border area with South Sudan. Past tribal conflict between Anyuak, Nuer, and Highlanders resulted in numerous casualties. As with other border areas, landmines and criminal activity remain a concern. Border with Sudan: There have been numerous incidents of armed clashes reported near the border area between Sudan and Ethiopia over disputed land. Somali Region (eastern Ethiopia): Al-Shabaab maintains a presence in Somali towns near the Ethiopian border, presenting risk of cross-border attacks and kidnapping. As with other border areas, landmines and criminal activity remain a concern. U.S. government personnel may not take personal trips to the Somali region. Afar: Violent crime, including the armed assault of foreigners, has occurred in the Danakil Depression in Afar. While recent reports may indicate the Danakil Depression area is safe for tourism, please note that tourism was previously targeted for attacks in 2007, 2012, and 2017. It is not recommended to use the Mekelle route to this or other tourist sites in the Afar region due to the current situation in the Tigray region. Travelers should remain alert for changing conditions and the potential for criminal activity in these areas. Travel to areas bordering Tigray is not recommended due to conflict in that region. Additionally, ethnic conflicts between Afar and Somalis in the southern border areas of Afar have been reported. Amhara: As a result of the Tigray conflict, tensions continue to exist along the Amhara-Tigray regional border, with occasional clashes including gunfire. Ethnic violence has been reported. While attacks are mostly related to inter-ethnic disputes and foreigners have not been targeted, attacks can occur at any time with the risk of being caught in violence. If you are travelling in the area, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities. Crime in Addis Ababa: Pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from vehicles and other petty crimes are common in Addis Ababa. Theft of passports is common in Bole International Airport, including inside the airport terminal and during airport transfers. Thieves are active throughout the city at all times, particularly on Bole Road, in the Piazza, the Merkato, and other areas frequented by tourists and foreigners. Violent robberies have also occurred in this area, with victims stabbed or beaten. Further, a number of violent robberies on hikers in Entoto Park, Yeka Park (behind the British Embassy), and the Guellele Botanical Gardens in Addis Ababa have been reported. Safety Precautions: Review your personal safety and security posture, remain vigilant, and exercise caution when visiting prominent public places and landmarks where westerners gather on a routine or predictable basis. Avoid unattended baggage or packages left in any location, including in taxis. Monitor consular messages. Avoid travel outside of major towns, particularly along border areas (Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan). Avoid walking alone. Do not display cash and valuable personal property. Secure your valuables and travel documents. Drive with doors locked and windows closed or rolled up enough at all times to prevent theft while stopped in traffic. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Border controls with the United Kingdom, including the Channel Tunnel crossing, have also been reestablished following Brexit. The Government of France routinely conducts security and crisis management drills involving deployment of security forces, emergency services, and police to high profile areas that may be near popular tourist sites. U.S. citizens should be aware of the possibility of drills and should heed instructions of local authorities should they encounter them. French police and military routinely patrol public spaces. You should expect security inspections (to include purses, bags, and backpacks) at the entrance to large public venues and businesses. When traveling or living in France, you should: Be aware of your local security situation and take appropriate steps to bolster your personal security. Monitor media and local information sources like France24, Radio France International, The Local, and the Paris Travel Information webpage and factor updated information into personal travel plans and activities.  Address specific safety concerns to French law enforcement authorities who have responsibility for the safety and security of all residents and visitors to France. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program\u202f(STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Crime: The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing (passports, phones, cash, credit cards), vehicle and residential break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft. Visitors to congested and popular tourist areas (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings. Rental cars are frequently targeted for break-ins when visitors exit their vehicles and leave valuables behind. Crimes of opportunity are more likely to involve violence on the street late at night or when the victim resists.  Exercise extra caution when out alone at night and/or consider traveling out at night with trusted companions. While the incidence of sexual assault is statistically low, attacks do occur. Be aware of \u201cdate-rape\u201d drugs, which are present in France. The Embassy has assisted multiple victims who appear to have been targeted using these drugs. Be cautious in bars and clubs where alcohol is served, and do not leave your drink unattended or accept a drink from strangers, as they may have slipped drugs into the drink.   There are high incidences of \u201csmash and grab\u201d robberies in economically depressed areas or on highly traveled thoroughfares such as roads to and from the airport. Thieves on foot or motorcycle will approach a vehicle that is stopped in traffic, smash a window, reach into the vehicle to grab a purse or other valuable item, and then flee. Keep doors locked and valuables out of sight. See our travel tips for Women Travelers. Demonstrations\u202foccur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.  Strikes can interfere with travel plans and increase expenses of traveling to France. Demonstration organizers must obtain prior police approval, and police routinely oversee participants. In case of violence or property damage, French authorities may use chemical agents and water cannons to disperse crowds. Alerts issued regarding demonstrations are posted on the U.S. Mission\u2019s website. International Financial Scams:\u202fSee the\u202fDepartment of State\u202fand the\u202fFBI\u202fpages for information.

    "Safety and Security": "Political rallies and social protests may occur spontaneously in Gabon, particularly in Libreville and Port Gentil. Even gatherings intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational or violent. Be aware of your surroundings and personal security at all times. Avoid large gatherings, protests, demonstrations, and any other event where crowds congregate. Police and security forces typically disperse crowds using tear gas or other force. Crime: Muggings, pick-pocketing, and theft of unattended possessions are the most common forms of crime visitors encounter. There have been reports of violent crime, including armed robbery. Vehicle break-ins and residential burglaries continue to be a problem in Libreville and Port Gentil. Carry identification at all times to minimize the risk of harassment at police checkpoints. Avoid poorly lit streets and unfamiliar areas of the city, especially at night. Avoid beaches after dusk. Carry a minimal amount of cash and avoid wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, especially in markets and nightlife spots. In a robbery, comply with the attacker to avoid injury. In the event of a fire, dial 18 in Libreville. In Port Gentil, please dial 07-63-93-63 or 01-56-27-75. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.

    "country_name": "Georgia",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations continue to plot possible attacks throughout Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Adjacent Areas: The United States and most other countries consider these regions part of Georgia. However, de facto local authorities claim independence, and Russian troops and border guards occupy both regions. Attacks, criminal incidents, and kidnappings have occurred in and around the areas. While none of the activity has been anti-American in nature, there is a high risk of travelers finding themselves in a wrong place/wrong time situation. Follow the guidance in our Travel Advisory for Georgia and do not travel to these regions. If you choose to travel there, you should be aware: U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to the Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia or South Ossetia. We are unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in either territory. U.S. government employees also are restricted from traveling within five kilometers of the administrative boundary line (ABL) dividing these regions from Tbilisi-administered territory. The administrative boundary line (ABL) of South Ossetia is not clearly marked in many places and frequently moving in other places. There is an elevated risk of wandering into South Ossetia unknowingly while hiking, particularly on the ABL\u2019s eastern side, which could result in detention by security forces. Unexploded ordnance left over from previous conflicts pose a danger near the administrative boundary line of South Ossetia. You may only legally enter these regions from the Georgian side, per Georgian law. You may be arrested, detained, imprisoned, and/or fined by Russian, Georgian or de facto authorities if you enter without proper documentation.  Medical services in the occupied territories are extremely limited. Hospitals do not accept credit cards or medical insurance, have little to no infectious disease control, and lack medicine. There are no commercial airports in either region making air ambulance evacuations impossible during medical emergencies. It is illegal to undertake any type of economic activity in Abkhazia or South Ossetia that requires permits, licenses, or registration, per Georgian law. Laws also ban mineral exploration, money transfers, and international transit via Abkhazia or South Ossetia. Pankisi Gorge: The Department of State cautions U.S. citizens against travel to the Pankisi Gorge region (north of the villages of Matane and Chorale, to the border with Russia, including the city of Duisk) because of the current security environment and the potential for civil unrest. There are restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel traveling to this region or within five kilometers of it. While the Georgian government has had success in combating terrorism within its borders, U.S. citizens should remain vigilant. ISIS recruiting has occurred in Pankisi in the past, and some known terrorists have confirmed ties to the Pankisi Gorge region.   Crime: Criminals may target foreigners. Take precautions against becoming a victim of crime as you would in any large city. Firearms are readily available in Georgia, assailants may be armed, and disputes with firearms could occur. Alcohol consumption is prevalent and has been attributed to escalating or exacerbating otherwise minor disputes. Carrying pocket knives or other cutting devices in Georgia is illegal under most circumstances.  You may be detained or cited if found in violation. There has been an increase in reports of \u201cconfidence scams\u201d where a traveler who orders drinks or food in a bar or restaurant is presented with a bill for exorbitantly high sums and then physically threatened if they do not pay. These are sometimes combined with \u201cromance scams\u201d wherein a traveler is taken to these establishments by someone they met online through a dating or other social meetup site. U.S. and other visitors have reported occurrences of sexual assault in Georgia. Avoid walking alone at night.  Exercise caution when riding alone in private taxis or \u201cmarshrutka\u201d mini buses. Maintain a low profile, do not carry large amounts of cash, and do not draw unnecessary attention to yourself. Use caution at ATMs, and always check for skimming devices or other tampering. Avoid using public WIFI networks or internet terminals as they did not protect your data or personal information. Foreign visitors report having items stolen from locked hotel rooms. Review additional information on crime threats in the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) Georgia Country Security Report. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredicatable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Security alerts about demonstrations can be found on the Embassy\u2019s website here.

The Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MOIA) operates a 24-hour emergency response center similar to 911 (dial 112) and transfers emergency calls to the fire and rescue service, police, or the nearest medical emergency center. Most dispatchers speak only Georgian and Russian but will transfer calls to English-speaking operators. Remember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. The U.S. Embassy has no law enforcement or legal authority overseas, nor can it investigate crimes in Georgia. U.S. embassy staff are prohibited by federal regulation from acting as agents, attorneys, or in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of U.S. citizens involved in legal disputes overseas.

Personal Safety in Remote Areas: If you intend to camp, climb, or hike in the mountains or any remote area in Georgia: Research local conditions in advance. Go with a companion or a group. Avoid traveling alone. Provide route and contact information to someone not traveling with you. Maintain communication with your family and friends. If in trouble, call the emergency number 112. Most dispatchers speak Georgian and Russian but will transfer calls to English-speaking operators. In the case of a crisis or natural disaster, U.S. citizens in Georgia may check the Embassy\u2019s website for U.S. Embassy emergency messages, or receive them by email by signing up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)."

Terrorists have targeted Westerners in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin, and Mali. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime:\u202f Violent crimes, such as armed robbery and kidnapping, occasionally occur. Robberies on highways are of particular concern, especially at night. Armed robbers also sometimes target vehicles coming from Kotoka International Airport. If your car is hit by another car while you are driving, go directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Reports of residential robberies continue to be on the rise. Street crime remains a serious problem in Accra and other large cities. Thieves carry out crimes of opportunity, such as \u201csnatch & grabs,\u201d on city streets in isolated areas as well as from vehicles idling in traffic. Pickpockets are also prevalent in crowded areas. Luggage and travel document theft occurs at Kotoka International Airport in Accra and in hotels across Ghana. Keep your documents secure at all times, and don\u2019t leave your baggage unattended. Be wary of all offers of unsolicited assistance at the airport from anyone other than uniformed porters or officials. Credit card fraud is common. Exercise caution when using credit and ATM cards in Ghana. It is very common for scammers to tamper with credit card terminals. Skimming is the primary means of credit card fraud, and is undetectable until fraudulent charges appear on statements. If you choose to use a credit card anywhere in Ghana, monitor your credit card activity closely. There are a number of ongoing chieftaincy disputes in Ghana that generally involve competition over limited resources. Several of these disputes have erupted into violence and unrest during recent years. Exercise caution in rural areas and remain alert to outbreaks of unrest.

    "country_name": "Greece",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. In the past year, there have been multiple terrorist attacks in Europe. Extremists continue to focus on tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities as viable targets. In addition, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, high-profile events, educational institutions, airports, and other soft targets remain priority locations for possible attacks. U.S. citizens should exercise additional vigilance in these and similar locations. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Strikes and Demonstrations: Domestic strikes, demonstrations, and work stoppages are common throughout Greece and can become violent. Stay informed through local news, hotel security, the U.S. Embassy website, and the Consular Section\u2019s Facebook page. Enroll in STEP to receive alerts sent by the Embassy. Transportation sector strikes interrupt traffic, public transportation, taxis, seaports, and airports. Confirm domestic and international flights before heading to the airport. Avoid all areas affected by the annual November 17 demonstrations, including the U.S. Embassy. Anarchists and criminals have used university campuses as refuges. Demonstrators frequently congregate in the Polytechnic University area, Exarchia, Omonia, and Syntagma Squares in Athens; and at Aristotle Square, Aristotle University, and the Kamara area in Thessaloniki. Violent anarchist groups have joined public demonstrations to clash with police and vandalize public and private property. Crime: Crimes against tourists, such as pick-pocketing and purse-snatching, occur at popular tourist sites and on public transportation, especially the metro. A common tactic is one person causes a commotion on the metro or pushes travelers to distract them while another person snatches the belongings. Thieves also seek out and break into rental cars to steal passports, valuables, and luggage. The Embassy has received reports of alcohol-induced attacks targeting individual tourists at some holiday resorts and bars. Take the following precautions: Be cautious and aware of your surroundings. Do not leave bags unattended, especially on the metro and the Athens Airport train or in your vehicle. Avoid standing near bus or train doors. Thieves often strike as the doors open then disappear into the crowd. Use alcohol in moderation and remain in control. Never leave drinks unattended in bars or clubs. Be discreet when discussing plans and organizing belongings upon arrival. Protect yourself and your money by using well-lit, public ATMs. Be aware of internet scams with online thieves posing as loved ones or romantic interests. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: Report crime to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+30) 210-720-2414 or the Emergency after-hours telephone (+30) 210-729-4444 if you require assistance.

Their emergency assistance call center \u2013 staffed with Spanish and English speakers \u2013 may be contacted 24/7 by calling 1500 or +502-2290-2810. You may also contact PROATUR by WhatsApp at +502-5188-1819. Crime: Theft, armed robbery, and carjacking are the most common crimes against U.S. citizens. Travelers have experienced carjackings and armed robberies upon leaving the airport.  Victims have been violently assaulted when they resisted an attack or refused to give up money or valuables. Pickpockets and purse-snatchers are prevalent in major cities and tourist sites, especially the central market and other parts of Zone 1 in Guatemala City. In a common scenario, an accomplice distracts the victim while an assailant slashes a bag or backpack or simply steals it. Reports of sexual assault remain high. Support for victims of sexual assault is lacking. The Guatemalan border with Mexico, in particular the northwestern corner of Pet\u00e9n, is a high-risk area due to large scale drug and alien smuggling.  There have been instances of narco-related homicides in this area, especially along CA-13. Visitors are encouraged to fly to nearby Flores when visiting Tikal. Travelers should remain in groups, stay on principal trails leading to the Central Plaza and the Temple IV complex, and avoid remote areas of the park. Due to heightened risk of crime, U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to go to Zone 18 in Guatemala City, Huehuetenango Department (except the city of Huehuetenango), and San Marcos Department (except the city of San Marcos).  For more detailed information, please see the Guatemala Travel Advisory. To decrease the likelihood of becoming a victim: Be aware of your surroundings. Report any crime incidents promptly to the police. Carry a photocopy of your passport in case you lose your passport. Do not use public ATMs. Only use ATMs inside secure bank lobbies or hotels. Scams involving attempts to acquire a victim\u2019s ATM card and personal identification number (PIN) are common. U.S. citizens have been victims of credit card scams where the card is copied and used improperly. Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive jewelry or watches. Refrain from using a cell phone on the street. A common crime against foreign citizens in Guatemala is robbery of cell phones. Do not use local public buses. U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to use any local buses. Avoid low-priced public inter-city buses (often recognizable as recycled and repainted U.S. school buses). Travelers also have been attacked on first-class buses on highway CA-2 near the border areas with both Mexico and El Salvador, on highways CA-1 and CA-9 near the border with El Salvador, and in the highlands between Quetzaltenango and Solol\u00e1.  Public buses are subject to frequent attacks by armed robbers, and often are poorly maintained and dangerously driven. Do not hail taxis on the street in Guatemala City, instead use radio-dispatched taxis (Taxi Amarillo), INGUAT-approved taxis from the \u201cSAFE\u201d stand at the Guatemala City airport, or hotel taxis. Uber is also considered safe to use in Guatemala City and Antigua. Tourist groups are advised to request security escorts. Security escorts for tourist groups are available from INGUAT and may be requested by calling 1500 or +502-2290-2800. Requests should be directed to the attention of the Coordinator of the National Tourist Assistance Program, and should provide the itinerary, names of travelers, and model and color of the vehicle in which they will be traveling. The request should be submitted by mail, fax, or e-mail, and should arrive at INGUAT at least three business days in advance of the proposed travel. INGUAT may not be able to accommodate all requests. Visit INGUAT\u2019s web site. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations  Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.  International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.   Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Guatemala. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:   Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the police through the tourist assistance program (PROATUR) at 1500 or +502-2290-2800 and contact the U.S. Embassy at+502-2354-0000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. The U.S. Embassy can: help you find appropriate medical care. assist you in reporting a crime to the police. contact relatives or friends with your written consent. provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion.  provide a list of local attorneys provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the United States. provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution. help you find accommodations and arrange flights home. replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate basic medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders may encounter obstacles to accessing areas outside of major cities, and/or be unable to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Water Safety: Basic safety measures and precautions for swimming, boating, and other outdoor activities may not be observed in Guatemala. Beware of strong currents, riptides, and undertows along Guatemala's Pacific coast beaches, as well as at Lake Atitlan.  Lifeguards are rarely present. Signs that warn of treacherous surf are rare and confined mostly to private beaches owned by hotels. Potential for Natural Disasters: There are four active volcanoes in Guatemala: Fuego, Pacaya, Tacan\u00e1, and Santiaguito. Volcanic activity has forced evacuations of nearby villages. U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to visit the Agua volcano due to the high incidence of robberies on the volcano. Be aware of the possibility of earthquakes at any time and make contingency plans.  Consult Guatemala\u2019s National Seismic Institute (INSIVUMEH) for updates on earthquakes and seismic activity. Both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Guatemala are vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms from mid-May through November. Mudslides and flooding during the May to November rainy season often kill dozens of people and close roads. Consult Guatemala\u2019s National Disaster Reduction Coordination Office (CONRED) for updates on natural disasters or tropical storms and hurricanes. Indigenous Areas:  Be mindful of local traditional practices when visiting indigenous Maya communities as tensions can rise quickly and locals occasionally take the law into their own hands. Particularly in small villages, residents are often wary and suspicious of outsiders. Avoid activities that might unintentionally violate a cultural or religious belief. In the past, Guatemalan citizens have been lynched for suspicion of child abduction. Maintain distance from local children and refrain from actions that could fuel such suspicions."

    "country_name": "Guinea",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: Burglaries and break-ins are common, as are purse snatchings and other street robberies. Many robberies occur in taxis. Follow routine personal security considerations such as locking doors, windows, and employ security alarms. U.S. citizen employees of the Embassy are prohibited from using local taxis. Motorists have occasionally encountered improvised checkpoint barricades manned by uniformed military or police personnel who demand money and search through personal belongings, confiscating items of value. See Victims of Crime section to report incidents. Do not accept unsolicited offers of assistance at the airport or hotels as these individuals may be seeking opportunities to rob visitors of their bags, purses, or wallets. You should arrange to be met at the airport by hotel personnel or business contacts. Keep car doors locked at all times to prevent carjacking and vehicle intrusion. Only roll car windows down enough to communicate when necessary. Soldiers staffing checkpoints at night and police at intersections during the day will often solicit bribes. Display requested documents, but do not surrender them, as officials may take them if bribes are not paid. You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown in place of your actual passports or identification cards. Demonstrations: Political tensions remain high since the 2021 military coup.  Protests around governance, utility and fuel problems, and labor disputes are common, causing disruptions to traffic and commerce.  Some prior protests have escalated into violence.  Demonstrators may attack vehicles that attempt to pass through or around the protests, resulting in serious injuries and vehicular damage. Criminals are known to take advantage of the resulting traffic congestion to rob drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Uniformed security forces may also extort drivers and passengers during these incidents. You should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings. Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Commercial scams are on the rise and can create legal difficulties for U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens have reported being detained by local authorities based on complaints by local business partners and/or as an attempt to extract additional payment. Scams can also target private business personnel and non-governmental organization employees, often with offers to sell diamonds or gold. In general, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The funds cannot be recovered. Other common scams include: Romance/Online dating  Money transfers  Lucrative sales  Gold purchase  Contracts with promises of large commissions  Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy. Report crimes in person at the nearest police station and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(224) 655-10-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

    "country_name": "Guinea-Bissau",
    "Safety and Security": "Guinea-Bissau lacks sufficient resources and infrastructure to ensure a stable security environment. Guinea-Bissau\u2019s instability is exacerbated by drug trafficking, as it is used as a transit point for drug shipments from Latin America. Crime: Non-violent crimes occur frequently. Law enforcement lacks the resources to respond effectively to crime. Expatriates and travelers are occasionally targeted for crimes of opportunity (petty theft, pickpocketing, theft from vehicles, minor assaults). Street criminals, aggressive vendors, and panhandlers frequently target foreigners in crowded areas and markets (particularly the popular Bandim Market) and travelers exiting the Bissau airport. According to law enforcement officials, travelers should also be cautious of the Mindara and Reino neighborhoods due to crime. The risk of being targeted by criminal actors greatly increases at night, due to Guinea-Bissau`s limited security infrastructure and lack of street and building lighting. Visitors are strongly discouraged from walking after dark, especially alone or in isolated areas. Even during daylight hours and in groups, travelers are advised to maintain a heightened level of security awareness, particularly in public places, tourist areas, and crowded locations. Corruption exists at all levels of government. Police and emergency personnel are poorly trained and lack resources to respond to crime and emergency situations effectively. Even if the police do respond to an incident, they usually lack the training and experience to conduct a proper investigation. People violating Bissau-Guinean laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or temporarily detained. All foreign visitors should carry identification (such as a certified copy of passport and/or residence permit). Narcotics trafficking is linked to criminal activity and aggressive assaults in rural areas of Guinea-Bissau.  Demonstrations\u202foccur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

    "country_name": "Guyana",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: Criminal activity, including murder and armed robbery, is common in Guyana. Exercise increased situational awareness in certain areas of Georgetown due to increased reports of robberies, sexual assaults and homicides. The neighborhoods of Agricola, Tiger Bay and Albouystown as well as Stabroek Market should be avoided at all times. During the day, exercise increased situational awareness at the National Park, Seawall and Bourda Market. At night, avoid the seawall east of Vlissengen Road, the National Park, and Bourda Market. Avoid walking in Georgetown after dark. Sexual Assault: Verbal sexual harassment is common and usually takes the form of catcalling and using lewd and sexually suggestive language to describe women\u2019s dress and appearance. This can occur anywhere groups of men congregate, for instance, bars, seawalls, construction sites, bus and car parks, and market areas. Reports of rape have increased within past year. Most victims knew their attacker. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call the domestic and sexual violence hotline, 914, and contact the Embassy. Domestic Violence:  Domestic violence, especially against women, is common in Guyana. Some police stations may have a domestic violence unit; however, not all police officers are trained to handle these cases. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call the domestic and sexual violence hotline, 914, and contact the Embassy. Border Dispute:  The ongoing dispute about the western border between Guyana and Venezuela has reportedly resulted in assaults, robberies, extortion, and murders in towns on both sides of the border. Fishing villages and mining camps are the most victimized. The Guyanese military and law enforcement lack the capacity to adequately face the challenges in this region. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

    "country_name": "The Gambia",
    "Safety and Security": "Avoid the areas of southern Gambia which border the Casamance region in Senegal, due to potential landmines. Crime: Petty street crime is common. Beware of pickpocketing, purse/bag-snatching, phone-snatching, and theft from vehicles. These crimes occur on ferries, on the beach, in markets and other commercial areas, and in hotels. Ensure that your travel documents, luggage, and valuable items are secure. Beware of \u201cbumsters\u201d - local men who approach tourists, particularly on beaches and tourist zones, offering help, to act as local guides or to enter into a relationship. They will often demand payment for their services, even if no agreement has been made. Be polite but firm in turning down unwanted help or attempts at conversation. Avoid walking alone, including on beaches, in tourist areas, and after dark. Do not display cash and valuable personal property. Drive with doors locked and windows closed or rolled up enough at all times to prevent theft while stopped in traffic. Demonstrations: Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Relationship fraud/scams: Internet and in-person friendship, romance and financial scams are prevalent in The Gambia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails, letters, WhatApp, texts, and/or contact initiated in person. Scammers sometimes pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help, others ask for assistance to help them and family members in need. They request financial assistance from victims to help pay for potentially fraudulent or potentially partially valid claims, such as for urgent medical treatment, school fees for numerous relatives, rent payments, car repair, payment of exit taxes, or government fines. Do not send money to anyone you have not met in person and whose situation you cannot independently verify. If you believe you might be a victim of an internet or similar scam, it is strongly recommended that you send no money nor gifts and completely disengage from all contact with the individual(s). See Internet Dating and Romance Scams. Business fraud/scams: The U.S. Embassy receives reports of scams in which U.S. businesses sent payment, but did not receive shipments. Be suspicious of any unsolicited offers to participate in lucrative business opportunities, especially if they require financial disclosures, money transfers, large up-front investments, or promises of confidentiality. Carefully scrutinize all proposals before you commit any funds, provide any goods or services, or undertake any travel. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in addition to Gambian police. Sexual assaults by relatives are often seen by police as family matters outside their jurisdiction and they may not investigate. Report crimes to the local police at 117 for police assistance or ambulatory services, and 118 for fire and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(220) 439-2856. The Gambian Police Force operates a 24 hour emergency line at (220) 422-4914. Please be advised that emergency responders may lack fuel for vehicles or face other resource challenges.

    "country_name": "Haiti",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: Embassy employees are prohibited from using public transportation and visiting certain areas of Port-au-Prince due to high crime. Political violence and violent crimes are common in Haiti, including murders, kidnappings, robberies, assaults, vehicle break-ins, and home invasions. Travelers are often targeted, followed, and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. For this reason, Embassy personnel are prohibited from traveling in personal vehicles to and from the airport. Also, the Embassy has procedures in place to detect surveillance and deter attacks on its employees. Labadee, a port near Cap Haitien in the north - only accessible by cruise ship passengers - has private security and lower rates of reported crime. Travelers should exercise heightened  precautions,however, due to increasing insecurity nationwide. Safety Precautions: Be careful about providing your destination address in Haiti. Do not provide personal information to unauthorized individuals located in the immigration, customs, or other areas inside or near any airports in Haiti. Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival. As you leave the airport, make sure you are not being followed. If you notice you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station immediately. Be aware of your surroundings. Keep a low profile. Do not display signs of wealth, such as jewelry or watches. Embassy employees are prohibited from visiting banks and using ATMs. U.S. citizens are often followed, attacked and robbed soon after withdrawing money. If you must use an ATM, select one that is out of sight from the general public (such as inside your hotel), and be cautious at all times. Do not resist a robbery or car-jacking attempt. Criminals may kill those who resist.  If a situation makes you feel uncomfortable, leave immediately. Be aware: drug traffickers have duped travelers into transporting narcotics aboard on commercial flights. Be aware: crime rates tend to go up during holidays, particularly in crowded street festivities. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault: Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Police investigations may not meet U.S. standards and forensic medical services are very basic. While rape kits exist in Haiti, there is generally no capacity to collect or utilize samples for police investigation. Report crimes to the local police at (+509) 3838-1111 or (+509) 3733-3640, then call the U.S. Embassy at (+509) 2229-8000. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

    "country_name": "Honduras",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: While crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country, municipalities along the north coast and central portions of the country have historically had the country\u2019s highest crime rates. Gracias a Dios  In particular, Gracias a Dios is a remote location where narcotics trafficking is commonplace, infrastructure is weak, government services are limited, and police or military presence is scarce. As a result, the U.S. Embassy has restricted U.S. government personnel travel to Gracias a Dios. U.S. citizens should not travel to Gracias a Dios. The Honduran government conducts police and military patrols in major cities in an effort to reduce crime. However, the ability of Honduran law enforcement authorities to prevent, respond to, and investigate criminal incidents, and to prosecute criminals is limited. Bay Islands and Copan Ruins  Areas frequented by tourists, such as the Bay Islands (including Roatan, Utila and Guanaja) and Copan Ruins, have notably lower rates of violent crime and increased law enforcement services. U.S. government employees have no restrictions on travel to these areas. Travelers should still exercise reasonable precautions. Of note, foreign residents of the Bay Islands who purchase properties have reported increased incidents of harassment, including being the victims of violent attacks, after becoming involved in disputes. Review your personal security plans; remain aware of your surroundings and local events; and monitor local news stations for updates. Maintain a high level of vigilance, take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security, and follow instructions of local authorities. Read the Travel Advisory for Honduras for additional information. Demonstrations:  Demonstrations regularly occur in Honduras, particularly near the Presidential Palace, Congress, and the universities in Tegucigalpa. Protests and work stoppages have become common at Ministerio Publico offices throughout the country, leading to interruptions in services. Additionally, some protests directed toward the U.S. government, usually small in size, can occur around the U.S. Embassy. In addition, there are often demonstrations on the CA-5, the main highway connecting Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. This highway is used to access or exit Palmerola International Airport \u2013 XPL, near Comayagua (54 miles north of Tegucigalpa). Palmerola is currently the main international airport for Tegucigalpa. Protests often result in the extended closure of major roads and highways in and between major cities, blocking the flow of goods, services and reducing access to daily household supplies. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Honduras should avoid large gatherings or events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches.  Victims of Crime: If you are a victim of crime, call the national police by dialing 911. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

Be aware of your surroundings (including local customs and etiquette) and keep a low profile. Monitor local news reports, vary your routes and times in carrying out daily activities, and consider the level of security present when you visit public places, including religious sites, and when choosing hotels, restaurants, and entertainment and recreation venues. India continues to experience terrorist and insurgent activities which may affect U.S. citizens directly or indirectly. Anti-Western terrorist groups, some on the U.S. government's list of foreign terrorist organizations, are active in India, including Islamist extremist groups such as Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami, Harakat ul-Mujahidin, Indian Mujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Lashkar-e Tayyiba. The U.S. government occasionally receives information regarding possible terrorist attacks that could take place in India, monitors such information to determine credibility, and advises U.S. citizens accordingly.  Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages from the Embassy automatically.    Past attacks have targeted public places, including some frequented by Westerners, such as luxury and other hotels, trains, train stations, markets, cinemas, mosques, and restaurants in large urban areas. Attacks have taken place during the busy evening hours in markets and other crowded places, but could occur at any time.  Alerts are usually more frequent around major holidays. The Maoists (also known as \u201cNaxalites\u201d) are the most active insurgent group in India. The Naxalites typically attack Indian government officials, but have also derailed trains, targeted other government buildings such as police stations, and conducted other criminal activity.  In eastern India\u2019s Bihar state, 10 security personnel were killed and five injured in a Naxalite-triggered Improvised Explosive Device blast on July 18, 2016.  In the eastern state of Jharkhand, seven policemen were killed and eight others injured in a landmine blast by Naxalites on January 27, 2016.    Beyond the threat from terrorism and insurgencies, demonstrations and general strikes, or \u201cbandh,\u201d often cause major inconvenience and unrest. These strikes can result in the stoppage of all transportation and tourist-related services, at times for 24 hours or more. U.S. citizens caught in such a strike may find they are unable to make flight and rail connections, as local transportation can be severely limited. Local media generally give an idea of the length and geographical location of the strike. Large religious gatherings that attract hundreds of thousands of people can result in dangerous and often life-threatening stampedes. Local demonstrations can begin spontaneously and escalate with little warning, disrupting transportation systems and city services and posing risks to travelers. In response to such events, Indian authorities occasionally impose curfews and/or restrict travel. You are urged to obey such curfews and travel restrictions and to avoid demonstrations and rallies as they have the potential for violence, especially immediately preceding and following political rallies, elections, and religious festivals (particularly when Hindu and Muslim festivals coincide). Tensions between castes and religious groups can also result in disruptions and violence. In some cases, demonstrators specifically block roads near popular tourist sites and disrupt train operations in order to gain the attention of Indian authorities; occasionally vehicles transporting tourists are attacked in these incidents. India generally goes on \u201cHigh Alert\u201d status prior to major holidays or events. You should monitor local television, print media, Mission India\u2019s American Citizens Services Facebook page, and enroll with the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program for further information about the current situation in areas where you will travel. The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General in Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai will post information about routine demonstrations on the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General websites, under the heading \u201cDemonstration Notices.\u201d Please monitor our websites regularly for information about protest activities in the country. Please note that the Embassy and Consulates General will issue emergency/security messages for other purposes, as necessary. Religious violence occasionally occurs in India, especially when tensions between different religious communities are purposefully exacerbated by groups pushing religiously chauvinistic agendas. There are active \"anti-conversion\" laws in some Indian states, and acts of conversion sometimes elicit violent reactions from Hindu extremists. Foreigners suspected of proselytizing Hindus have been attacked and killed in conservative, rural areas in India in the past.  Swimming in India: You should exercise caution if you intend to swim in open waters along the Indian coastline, particularly during the monsoon season. Every year, several people in Goa, Mumbai, Puri (Odisha), off the Eastern Coast in the Bay of Bengal, and other areas drown due to strong undertows. It is important to heed warnings posted at beaches and to avoid swimming in the ocean during the monsoon season. Trained lifeguards are very rare along beaches. If you visit the Andaman Islands, be aware that there have been reports of crocodile attacks in salt water resulting in fatalities.  Ask local residents about dangerous sea life before swimming and keep a safe distance from animals at all times. Wildlife safaris: India offers opportunities for observation of wildlife in its natural habitat and many tour operators and lodges advertise structured, safe excursions into parks and other wildlife viewing areas for close observation of flora and fauna. However, safety standards and training vary, and it is a good idea to ascertain whether operators are trained and licensed. Even animals marketed as \u201ctame\u201d should be respected as wild and extremely dangerous. Keep a safe distance from animals at all times, remaining in vehicles or other protected enclosures when venturing into game parks. Trekking in India: Trekking expeditions should be limited to routes identified for this purpose by local authorities. Use only registered trekking agencies, porters, and guides, suspend trekking after dark, camp at designated camping places, and travel in groups rather than individually or with one or two companions. Altitudes in popular trekking spots can be as high as 25,170 feet (7,672 m); please make sure that you have had a recent medical checkup to ensure that you are fit to trek at these altitudes and carry sufficient medical insurance that includes medical evacuation coverage. Train Travel: India has the third largest rail network in the world, and train travel in India generally is safe. Nevertheless, accidents and on-board fires are sometimes caused by aging infrastructure, poorly maintained equipment, overcrowding, and operator errors. Train accidents and fires have resulted in the death and serious injury of passengers. Areas of Instability:  Jammu & Kashmir: The Department of State strongly recommends that you avoid travel to the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir because of the potential for terrorist incidents as well as violent public unrest. A number of terrorist groups operate in the territory targeting security forces, particularly along the Line of Control (LOC) separating Indian and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, and those stationed in primary tourist destinations in the Kashmir Valley: Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. Since 1989, as many as 70,000 people (terrorists, security forces, and civilians) have been killed in the Kashmir conflict. Foreigners are particularly visible, vulnerable, and at risk. In the past, serious communal violence left the territory mostly paralyzed due to massive strikes and business shutdowns, and U.S. citizens have had to be evacuated by local police. The Indian government prohibits foreign tourists from visiting certain areas along the LOC (see the section on Restricted Areas, below). India-Pakistan Border: The Department of State recommends that you avoid travel to areas within ten kilometers of the border between India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official India-Pakistan border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the state of Punjab between Atari, India, and Wagah, Pakistan. The border crossing is usually open, but you are advised to confirm the current status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. A Pakistani visa is required to enter Pakistan. Only U.S. citizens residing in India may apply for a Pakistani visa in India. Otherwise you should apply for a Pakistani visa in your country of residence before traveling to India. Both India and Pakistan claim an area of the Karakoram mountain range that includes the Siachen glacier. Travel or mountain climbing in this area is highly dangerous. The disputed area includes the following peaks: Rimo Peak; Apsarasas I, II, and III; Tegam Kangri I, II and III; Suingri Kangri; Ghiant I and II; Indira Col; and Sia Kangri. Check with the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi for information on current conditions. Northeastern states: Incidents of violence by ethnic insurgent groups, including bombings of buses, trains, rail lines, and markets, occur occasionally in the northeast. While U.S. citizens have not been specifically targeted, it is possible that you could be affected as a bystander. If you travel to the northeast, you should avoid travel by train at night, travel outside major cities at night, and crowds. U.S. government employees at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India are prohibited from traveling to the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur without permission from the U.S. Consulate General in Kolkata. Restricted Area Permits are required for foreigners to visit certain Northeastern states (see the section on Restricted Areas, below.) Contact the U.S. Consulate General in Kolkata for information on current conditions. East Central and Southern India: Maoist extremist groups, or \u201cNaxalites,\u201d are active in East Central India primarily in rural areas. The Naxalites have a long history of conflict with state and national authorities, including frequent terrorist attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials, and are responsible for more attacks in the country than any other organization through an ongoing campaign of violence and intimidation Naxalites have not specifically targeted U.S. citizens but have attacked symbolic targets that have included Western companies and rail lines. While Naxalite violence does not normally occur in places frequented by foreigners, there is a risk that visitors could become victims of violence. Naxalites are active in a large swath of India from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal, particularly in rural parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and on the borders of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. Due to the fluid nature of the threat, all U.S. government travelers to states with Naxalite activity must receive authorization from the U.S. Consulate responsible for the area to be visited. U.S. officials traveling only to the capital cities in these states do not need prior authorization. Restricted/Protected areas: While the Indian Government has designated that travelers to \u201cportions\u201d of certain areas need special advance permission, actual practice has been to require a permit to enter any portion of certain states or territories. Areas requiring a permit include: The state of Arunachal Pradesh Portions of the state of Sikkim Portions of the state of Himachal Pradesh near the Chinese border Portions of the state of Uttarakhand (Uttaranchal) near the Chinese border Portions of the state of Rajasthan near the Pakistani border Portions of the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir near the Line of Control with Pakistan and certain portions of the union territory of Ladakh The union territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands The union territory of the Laccadives Islands (Lakshadweep) Portions of the state of Manipur Portions of the state of Mizoram Portions of the state of Nagaland More information about travel to/in restricted/protected areas can be found from India\u2019s Bureau of Immigration. \u201cRestricted Area Permits\" are available outside India at Indian embassies and consulates abroad, or in India from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Foreigners Division) at Jaisalmer House, 26 Man Singh Road, New Delhi. The states of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim maintain official guesthouses in New Delhi, which can also issue Restricted Area Permits for their respective states for certain travelers. While visiting Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram) in Tamil Nadu, be aware the Indira Gandhi Atomic Research Center, Kalpakkam, is located just south of the site and is not clearly marked as a restricted and dangerous area. For the latest security information, travelers should enroll in STEP to receive updated security information and regularly monitor travel information available from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi as well as the U.S. Consulates General in Mumbai (Bombay), Chennai(Madras), Hyderabad, and Kolkata (Calcutta). CRIME: Petty crime, especially theft of personal property (including U.S. passports), is common, particularly on trains or buses, at airports, and in major tourist areas. Pickpockets can be very adept and women have reported having their bags snatched, purse-straps cut, or the bottom of their purses slit without their knowledge. If you are traveling by train, lock your sleeping compartments and take your valuables with you when leaving your berth. If you travel by air, be careful with your bags in the arrival and departure areas outside airports. Violent crime, especially directed against foreigners, has traditionally been uncommon, although in recent years there has been a modest increase. Be cautious about displaying cash or expensive items to reduce the chance of being a target for robbery or other crime, and be aware of your surroundings when you use ATMs. ATM card scams have been used to clone credit card details to withdraw money. Sexual Assault: Travelers should be aware that there have been reported cases of sexual assault, including rape, of U.S. citizens traveling throughout India. U.S. citizens, particularly women, are cautioned not to travel alone in India. Women traveling in India are advised to respect local dress and customs. Customary everyday dress for Indian women throughout the country is conservative, and even more so in non-urban areas,  with women wearing clothing that covers their legs and shoulders. Exceptions are vacation resorts catering to foreign clientele and some neighborhoods of the major cities of New Delhi and Mumbai. Western women, especially those of African descent, continue to report incidents of verbal and physical harassment by individuals and groups of men. Known locally as \u201cEve-teasing,\u201d these incidents of sexual harassment can be quite frightening and can quickly cross the line from verbal to physical. Sexual harassment can occur anytime or anywhere, but most frequently has happened in crowded areas such as in market places, train stations, buses, and public streets. The harassment can range from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to catcalls to outright groping. The Government of India has focused greater attention on addressing issues of gender violence. One outcome has been greater reporting of incidences of sexual assault country-wide, and Indian authorities report rape is one of the fastest growing crimes in India. Among large cities, Delhi experienced the highest number of reported crimes against women. Although most victims have been local residents, recent sexual attacks against female visitors in tourist areas across India underline the fact that foreign women are at risk and should exercise vigilance. Women should observe stringent security precautions, including avoiding use of public transport after dark without the company of known and trustworthy companions, restricting evening entertainment to well-known venues, and avoiding isolated areas when alone at any time of day. Keep your hotel room number confidential and make sure hotel room doors have chains, deadlocks, and peep holes. Travel with groups of friends rather than alone. In addition, only hire reliable cars and drivers and avoid traveling alone in hired taxis, especially at night. Use taxis from hotels and pre-paid taxis at airports rather than hailing them on the street. If you encounter threatening situations, call \u201c100\u201d for police assistance (\u201c112\u201d from mobile phones). Scams: Major airports, train stations, popular restaurants, and tourist sites are often used by scam artists looking to prey on visitors, often by creating a distraction. Beware of taxi drivers and others, including train porters, who solicit travelers with \"come-on\" offers of cheap transportation and/or hotels. Travelers accepting such offers have frequently found themselves the victims of scams, including offers to assist with \"necessary\" transfers to the domestic airport, disproportionately expensive hotel rooms, unwanted \"tours,\" unwelcome \"purchases,\" extended cab rides, and even threats when the tourists decline to pay.  There have been reports of tourists being lured, held hostage and extorted for money in the face of threats of violence against the traveler and his/her family members. You should exercise care when hiring transportation and/or guides and use only well-known travel agents to book trips. Some scam artists have lured travelers by displaying their name on a sign when they leave the airport. Another popular scam is to drop money or to squirt something on the clothing of an unsuspecting traveler and use the distraction to rob them of their valuables. Tourists have also been given drugged drinks or tainted food to make them more vulnerable to theft, particularly at train stations. Even food or drink prepared in front of the traveler from a canteen or vendor could be tainted. Some vendors sell carpets, jewelry, gemstones, or other expensive items that may not be of the quality promised. Deal only with reputable businesses and do not hand over your credit cards or money unless you are certain that goods being shipped are the goods you purchased. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it is best avoided. Most Indian states have official tourism bureaus set up to handle complaints. There have been a number of other scams perpetrated against foreign travelers, particularly in Goa, Jaipur, and Agra that target younger travelers and involve suggestions that money can be made by privately transporting gems or gold (both of which can result in arrest) or by taking delivery abroad of expensive carpets, supposedly while avoiding customs duties. The scam artists describe profits that can be made upon delivery of the goods, and require the traveler to pay a \"deposit\" as part of the transaction. India-based criminals use the internet to extort money from victims abroad.  In a common scam, the victim develops a close romantic relationship with an alleged U.S. citizen they meet online. When the \u201cfriend\u201d travels to India, a series of accidents occur and the victim begins to receive requests for financial assistance, sometimes through an intermediary.  In fact, the U.S. citizen \u201cfriend\u201d does not exist; they are only online personas used by criminal networks. Victims have been defrauded of thousands of dollars in these schemes. Do not send money to anyone you have not met in person and carefully read the Department of State\u2019s advice on international financial scams.  U.S. citizens have had problems with business partners, usually involving property investments. You may wish to seek professional legal advice in reviewing any contracts for business or services offered in India. The U.S. Embassy and/or consulates are unable to provide legal advice or intervene on behalf of United States citizens with Indian courts on civil or criminal matters.  A list of local attorneys is available on the Embassy and Consulates General websites. In another common scam, family members in the United States, particularly older people, are approached for funds to help callers claiming to be grandchildren or relatives who have been arrested or are without money to return home. Do not send money without contacting the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General to confirm the other party\u2019s situation. You can also call our Office of Overseas Citizens Services at 888-407-4747 (from overseas: 202-501-4444). Review our information on Emergency Assistance to Americans Abroad.  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for more information on scams. Don\u2019t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, if you purchase them you may also be breaking local law. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the local police, then inform the U.S. Embassy or local Consulate. Report crimes to the local police by calling \u201c100\u201d or \u201c112\u201d from a mobile phone.                       Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: help you find appropriate medical care assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution help you find accommodation and arrange flights home replace a stolen or lost passport Please note that you should ask for a copy of the police report, known as a \u201cFirst Information Report\u201d (FIR), from local police when you report an incident. Local authorities generally are unable to take any meaningful action without the filing of a police report.  If your passport is stolen, you should immediately report the theft or loss to the police in the location where your passport was stolen. A FIR is required by the Indian government in order for you to obtain an exit visa to leave India if the lost passport contained your Indian visa. Although the Embassy or Consulate General is able to replace a stolen or lost passport, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) are responsible for approving an exit permit. This process usually takes three to four working days, but can take longer. In cases of sexual assault or rape, the Embassy or Consulates General can provide a list of local doctors and hospitals, if needed, to determine if you have been injured and to discuss treatment and prevention options for diseases and pregnancy. You should be aware that in order for evidence of an assault to be submitted in a court case, Indian authorities require that the medical exam be completed at a government hospital. Therefore, if a victim goes to a private hospital for treatment, the hospital will refer them to a government hospital for this aspect of the medical process.  There are a number of resources in India for victims of rape and sexual assault. The specific toll-free Women\u2019s Helpline Service number in Delhi is 1091; in Mumbai it is 103; in Kolkata, 1090; in Chennai, 1091 or 2345-2365; and in Hyderabad one can dial 1-800-425-2908 or 1098 for crimes in general. The local equivalent to the \u201c911\u201d emergency line in India is \u201c100.\u201d An additional emergency number, \u201c112,\u201d can be accessed from mobile phones. Please see our information for victims of crime, including possible victim compensation programs in the United States.  Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage."

    "country_name": "Indonesia",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Extremists in Indonesia aspire to carry out violent attacks against Indonesian and foreign targets, and police have arrested more than 1,200 individuals on terrorism-related charges since 2018. Extremists may target both official and private establishments, including government offices, hotels, bars, nightclubs, shopping areas, restaurants, and places of worship. Be aware of your personal safety and security at all times. Recent incidents of extremist violence include a December 2022 suicide bombing at a police station in Bandung, West Java that killed one police officer, a March 2021 bomb attack against a church in Makassar, South Sulawesi which injured 20 civilians, and May 2018 bomb attacks against three churches in Surabaya, East Java which killed 15 civilians and injured 50. Demonstrations are very common in Jakarta, Surabaya, and other large cities, but less common in Bali. You should avoid demonstrations and other mass gatherings, since even those intended to be peaceful can become violent. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests.  Demonstrations may become more frequent ahead of the Indonesian general elections scheduled for February 2024. Currently, travel by U.S. government personnel to the provinces of Central Papua (Papua Tengah) and Highland Papua (Papua Pegunungan) is restricted to mission-essential travel that is approved in advance by the Embassy. Papuan separatists have kidnapped foreigners in the past and a New Zealand national was kidnapped by a separatist group in Nduga Regency in February 2023. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: In the last year several American citizens were victims of violent and serious crimes in Indonesia, particularly in Bali. As with any major tourist destination, U.S. citizens traveling in Indonesia are especially encouraged to always remain vigilant of their surroundings and read the following advisories carefully. Take sensible measures to protect yourself and your belongings.  Closely monitor bags and luggage and carry only essential items. Take particular care of your passport and bank cards and avoid traveling alone. Police presence and responsiveness is less than it is in the United States, making it more difficult to report crimes quickly and receive police attention. U.S. citizens often cite language barriers as a major hindrance when reporting crimes. Pickpocketing, sexual assault, vehicle theft, armed car-jacking, snatch and grab robberies of cell phones and purses, and residential break-ins are common. Avoid traveling to isolated areas late at night. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly vehicles or individuals that might be following you. Use a reputable taxi company or hire a taxi either at a major hotel or shopping center and ensure the driver\u2019s identity card is visible. If you are booking a car via a mobile app, always ensure that the driver is the same as the person on the app, share your journey with a friend via the in-app option, and know the contact information for the app\u2019s security center. Be aware of drivers falsely claiming to be registered with online ride hailing apps. Credit card fraud is a common problem in Indonesia. Criminals have \u201cskimmed\u201d credit/debit cards to access and drain bank accounts. Use an ATM in a secure location, such as a major bank branch, and check the machine for evidence of tampering. Monitor your account statements regularly. Tourists and Indonesians have suffered from serious illness and have even died from \"drink-spiking\u201d and drink poisoning incidents, particularly in clubs and nightspots in urban and tourist areas. There have been reports of sexual assaults and drink spiking in Bali, Lombok, and the Gili Islands.  Make sure drinks are prepared in your sight and be careful about accepting drinks from strangers at clubs and parties or leaving drinks unattended. Tourists have also been robbed after taking visitors to their hotel rooms, and in some cases have found that their drinks were spiked. There have also been deaths and serious illnesses caused by drinking alcoholic drinks contaminated with methanol. These cases have occurred in bars, shops, and hotels in popular tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands, and Sumatra. Sexual Assault: Women travelling alone may be subject to harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault, harassment, and rape occur. To minimize the risk, avoid travelling alone, especially at night; remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas; and be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Local authorities may not respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General.   Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Participating in demonstrations on a tourist visa can lead to deportation. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams occur in Indonesia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Victims of Crime: Sexual assault: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek prompt medical assistance, contact the Embassy or nearest Consulate, and call the local police at 112. For a criminal investigation to be initiated by the police, the victim must make a full statement to the local police, in person.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault may choose to be accompanied by a translator. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution. Follow this link for more information Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism and recreational activity industries are unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  Water sports, especially diving, can be hazardous in Indonesia with operators lightly regulated and hyperbaric chambers available only in Bali and Ambon.  Traffic is hazardous in Indonesia and U.S. citizens are frequently injured while riding rented motorbikes. Wearing a helmet is required by law. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities, and only basic stabilization may be available. Serious injuries require medical evacuation to another country. First responders are generally unable to provide urgent medical treatment or to access areas outside of major cities. Boat and ferry incidents are frequent; vessels rarely carry appropriate sizes and numbers of safety vests; passengers are encouraged to bring their own. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage (http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html). Please note:  The U.S. Embassy and Consulates do not pay the medical expenses of private U.S. citizens in Indonesia. It is the traveler\u2019s responsibility to ensure adequate medical insurance coverage or funds for medical expenses."

    "country_name": "Iran",
    "Safety and Security": "As noted in the Travel Advisory for Iran, U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Iran face a significant threat of kidnapping or arrest and detention on spurious charges. U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite the Travel Advisory should exercise caution throughout the country, but especially in the southeastern region where foreigners have been victims of criminal gangs. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to areas within 100 kilometers of the border with Afghanistan, near the Iraq border, and generally anywhere east of the line from Bam and Bandar Abbas toward the Pakistani border. Terrorism: In Iran, there is potential for death or injury because of terrorist attacks. Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for bombings and other attacks in Iran. The threat of terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders. Additionally, Iran is a designated state-sponsor of terrorism. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Foreigners occasionally become victims of petty street crime, including robberies and bag-snatchings, in Iran. There have been reports of robberies by police impersonators, usually in civilian clothing. Insist on seeing the officer\u2019s identity card and request the presence of a uniformed officer/marked patrol car. Travelers should take the following precautions: Do not surrender any documents or cash; Make a copy of your U.S. passport (biographical data page and the page with your Iranian visa) and keep it separate from your original passport; Do not carry large amounts of hard currency while on the streets; Keep important documents such as passports and valuables in hotel safes or other secure locations; Take pre-booked taxis, which are safer than those hailed from the street; Check with your hotel or tour guide for information on local scams; and Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, purchasing them may also violate local law. Demonstrations occur sporadically. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Past demonstrations have turned violent. As demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Iranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, computers, fax machines, and other electronics may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. The Iranian authorities may also confiscate cell phones, computers, and other devices. U.S. citizens should consider not taking electronic devices to Iran or deleting personal information from them beforehand. Disaster Preparedness: Iran is prone to earthquakes, many of them severe. To learn more about the seismic regions of Iran, including the most recent earthquakes, please visit the U.S. Geological Survey website. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 110 and contact the Embassy of Switzerland\u2019s Foreign Interests Section at (98) (21) 2254-2178. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Da\u2019esh, is a designated terrorist organization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border. ISIS and its associated terrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite improved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. citizens for attacks and hostage-taking. Iraq\u2019s northern borders are especially dangerous due to the continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups, armed conflict, aerial bombardment, and civil unrest.  U.S. citizens should especially avoid areas near armed groups in northern Iraq, which have been targeted with aerial strikes by neighboring countries\u2019 militaries. Due to security and safety threats, U.S. government personnel in Iraq live and work under strict security guidelines, which limit their movements and interactions. Crime:\u202f Carjacking is common, even during daylight hours, and particularly on the highways from Jordan and Kuwait to Baghdad.  Kidnappings of foreigners, Iraqi citizens, and dual U.S.-Iraqi citizens can occur for ransom or political/religious reasons.  Many hostages have been killed.\u202f The murder rate remains high due to terrorism, tribal and family disputes, and religious/sectarian tensions.  Sexual assault and domestic violence are common.  Petty theft is common in Iraq, including pickpocketing and theft of valuables from hotel rooms and private residences. Demonstrations\u202foccur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Rates of theft and petty crime have risen in recent years, and thieves often target tourists. In rare cases, these crimes involve physical assault or violence, more commonly in Dublin city center and in popular tourist areas. Rental cars are frequently targeted. They are easily identifiable by the rental company stickers on the rear window of the vehicle. If possible, remove these stickers and always lock your car when leaving it unattended. Do not leave valuables unattended in vehicles. When visiting city center areas, park your car in a secure car park and retain the parking ticket on your person. Keep car doors locked while driving. Don\u2019t leave luggage or valuables visible inside a parked car and don\u2019t leave luggage on a roof rack. When picking up and dropping off your rental car, do not leave the keys in the ignition while loading or unloading luggage. When using ATMs, protect your PIN at all times and look closely at ATMs for evidence of tampering before use. Criminals may use small electronic devices attached to the outside of ATMs called \u201cskimmers\u201d to steal the ATM or credit card data. In busy areas, thieves use distraction techniques at ATMs, such as waiting until the PIN has been entered and then pointing to money on the ground or asking for loose change. While the ATM user is distracted, another person will quickly withdraw cash and leave. If you are distracted in any way, cancel the transaction immediately. When using credit cards to pay at restaurants, a portable card reader should be brought to your table. Restaurant staff should not take your card elsewhere to process a charge.

    "country_name": "Italy",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Politically motivated violence in Italy is most often connected to Italian internal developments or social issues. Italian authorities and foreign diplomatic facilities have found bombs outside public buildings, have received bomb threats, and have been targets of letter bombs, firebombs and Molotov cocktails in the past several years. These attacks generally occur at night, and although they have not targeted or injured U.S. citizens, you should remain aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious activity to local authorities. Crime: Italy has a moderate rate of crime, especially for theft and economic crimes; violent crimes are rare. U.S. citizens should be aware of the following local circumstances: Tourists can be fined or detained for buying counterfeit goods (usually fashion accessories). Travelers must purchase train, bus, or metro tickets and validate them by punching them in validating machines prior to boarding (usually near the entrance of the train or metro or on the bus). Tickets may be purchased at tobacco stores or kiosks or, in some cities, via Apps or SMS. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an on-the-spot fine by an inspector on the train, bus, or metro. If the violator does not pay the fine on the spot, it will automatically double and be forwarded to the violator\u2019s home address. Be alert that many municipalities of cities in Italy have issued local restrictions banning certain activities in fountains or on monuments, such as eating, drinking, sitting, or bathing, as well as regarding the consumption of alcohol both indoors and outdoors after certain hours of the night. Violating these regulations can result in fines. Tourists are advised to check the official website of each city they plan to visit to learn the details. Thieves sometimes impersonate police officers. If you are stopped by a plainclothes policeman, ask for a uniformed officer or insist on seeing an officer's identification card (documento). Do not hand over your wallet and immediately report the incident to the actual police at a police station or by dialing 112 from a local phone. Do not leave bags unattended. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, at airports, car rental agencies, on public buses, metros and trains, and at the major railway stations. Never leave baggage alone in a car, including in a closed trunk. For more information on trains and security, please see the Italian railway police\u2019s advice for travelers. Be alert to criminal schemes. Organized groups of thieves and pickpockets operate at major tourist destinations, in train stations, bars, and cafes. Some travelers have reported incidents in which criminals used drugs to assault or rob them. Thieves on motor scooters regularly snatch purses or bags off pedestrians. Resisting these thieves can be dangerous. Keep your car doors locked and windows rolled up at all times to avoid car-jackings and thefts while you are waiting in traffic. The U.S. Secret Service in Rome is assisting Italian law enforcement authorities in investigating an increase in the appearance of ATM skimming devices. Here are some helpful hints to protect against and identify skimming devices: Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or secured inside a bank/business. Cover the keypad with one hand as you enter your PIN. Look for gaps, tampered appearance, or other irregularities between the metal faceplate of the ATM and the card reader. Avoid card readers that are not flush with the face of the ATM. Closely monitor your account statements for unauthorized transactions. Potential for Natural Disasters: Several major earthquake fault lines cross Italy, and earthquakes are frequent. High tides in Venice, flooding, and avalanches in mountainous areas may occasionally occur. The Italian Civil Protection agency has a robust capability to assist Italians and foreigners in the area of a natural disaster. Information about crisis preparedness and on-going crises affecting parts of Italy can be found on the Civil Protection web site at: Civil Protection Italy. General information about disaster preparedness is also available online from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Detailed information on Italy's fault lines is available from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Italy also has several active volcanoes, including Mt. Etna in eastern Sicily. Travelers to Sicily should be aware of the possibility for travel disruptions, including airport closures, in the event of volcanic activity, and are advised to check the website of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia for detailed information and daily updates. Italy has many other areas of potential volcanic activity especially in the vicinity of Naples. Any visit to an active volcano or volcanic field bears a certain amount of risk. Eruptions can occur with little to no warning. Travelers should exercise caution, follow posted instructions, stay on authorized trails, and use reputable tour operators. Demonstrations occur frequently and can be anti-American in nature, especially in areas hosting U.S. military bases. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Security Messages for U.S. citizens pertaining to demonstrations can be found on the Embassy\u2019s website. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Italy. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical attention at the nearest public hospital as soon as possible. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are also encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at +(39) 06-4674-1. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112.

If you are a victim of terrorism or organized crime in Italy, you are entitled to economic (special compensation and a life income) and non-economic benefits (special access to certain state jobs). In case of death, victims will include family members. You must file the application with the local Prefect\u2019s office (Prefettura - the local representative for the Ministry of Interior) where the crime occurred, providing the date, location, injuries, and losses resulting from the crime. If you are a victim of a hit and run driver, you can apply for compensation of damages to the Fondo Di Garanzia per le Vittime della Strada but only if: (i) the responsible vehicle cannot be identified, is not covered by car insurance, or it circulated against the owner\u2019s will; (ii) if the car insurance company went bankrupt; or (iii) if the accident was caused by a foreign vehicle with a license number that does not match or does not match anymore that same vehicle. U.S. citizens should consult an attorney licensed to practice in Italy to clarify time limits for a specific legal action. Victims of hit and run drivers and their families may seek assistance by reaching out to an Italian non-governmental organization (NGO) called Associazione Italiana Familiari e Vittime della Strada (AIFVS), \u201cAssociation of Italian Family Members and Victims of Hit and Run Drivers\u201d. AIFVS provides legal and psychological assistance through a network of professionals associated with the NGO. Please visit AIFVS for more details. If you are a victim of a violent intentional crime, you are entitled to compensation from the Italian government to cover the medical and welfare expenses you incurred, except for sexual assaults and murders cases where the compensation is due even if no medical and welfare expense was sustained. To be eligible for the compensation, your annual income must be within a certain limit. In addition, you must prove that you have already unsuccessfully tried to enforce the decision ordering compensation for damages. We recommend you contact an attorney licensed to practice in Italy for more information. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or nearest Consulate for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance."

    "country_name": "Jamaica",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: Violent crime, including sexual assault, is a serious problem throughout Jamaica, particularly in Kingston and Montego Bay. Jamaica\u2019s police force often does not respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a conclusive sentence. Families of U.S. citizens killed in accidents or homicides frequently wait a year or more for final death certificates to be issued by Jamaican authorities. Gated resorts are not immune to violent crime. Recommendations: Avoid walking or driving at night. Avoid public buses. Avoid secluded places or situations. Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Be aware of your surroundings and keep a low profile. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. Follow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter. Review the Crime and Safety Report for Jamaica. U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler\u2019s Checklist. International Financial Scams:  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Jamaica. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include: Lotteries Romance/Online dating Money transfers The most notorious Jamaican scam is the Lotto Scam, a kind of advance-fee fraud. The victim is led to believe that a Jamaican lottery prize will be released after the payment of \u201cfees.\u201d You did NOT win a lottery. The person on the telephone is lying. Just hang up. Never send money to someone who calls to say you have won the lottery in Jamaica. Do not travel to Jamaica to collect a \u201cprize.\u201d Victims have been killed, kidnapped, extorted, or robbed. Be very cautious about sending money to help a traveler claiming to be in trouble. When in doubt, contact your local police department for advice and assistance. Be wary of promises to protect a loved one from harm or to help the loved one out of trouble, in exchange for money. That is extortion \u2013 contact your local police department. Scam artists often fake romantic interest to get money from a would-be lover, especially on the internet. When in doubt, contact your local police department. If you are being targeted for financial scams, you will need to file a report with your local police department. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 119 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +1 (876) 702-6000.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Sexual Assault:  Rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. Date rape drugs may be used at private parties and resorts. If you are victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible. In a hotel, management should assist you with these communications. Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States. Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. Counseling is unlikely to be offered. Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly, and victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process. Recommendations: Avoid secluded places or situations, including at resorts. Try to always be accompanied by someone you know, including when going to the restroom. Security outside of resort areas is unpredictable, especially at night. Do not leave resort property with someone you have just met. Many guests drink heavily in all-inclusive resorts, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and increased vulnerability.  Shout for help immediately if you feel threatened or encounter individuals who make you feel uncomfortable.  Report any suspicious or inappropriate activity, including inappropriate comments or behavior by hotel employees or other guests, to hotel management, the U.S. Embassy, and local police as appropriate.R esort employees are generally prohibited from engaging in romantic or sexual relations with guests.

    "Safety and Security": "For police services in Japan, dial 110. For fire or ambulance services, dial 119. Crime: Crime against U.S. citizens in Japan is generally low and usually involves personal disputes, theft, or vandalism. In addition: Robberies committed after a victim has been drugged from a spiked drink can occur, especially in nightlife districts. Sexual assaults are not often reported, but they do occur, and victims may be randomly targeted.  Victim's assistance resources or shelters are difficult for foreigners to access. Hate-related violent crimes rarely occur, although some U.S. citizens have reported being the target of discrimination because of their nationality or their race. Pick pocketing can occur in crowded shopping areas, on trains, and at airports. Police reports must be filed before leaving Japan, as Japanese police will not accept reports filed from overseas.  In instances involving credit card theft or fraud, Japanese police often provide a report number rather than a police report.  You can provide this report number to your credit card company to confirm the incident with the police. Entertainment and Nightlife Districts in Tokyo:  Exercise caution in all entertainment and nightlife districts throughout Japan, especially Roppongi, Kabuki-cho, Shibuya, and Ikebukuro.  Incidents involving U.S. citizens in these areas include physical and sexual assaults, drug overdoses, theft of purses, wallets, cash and credit cards at bars or clubs, and drugs slipped into drinks.  Drink spiking at bars and entertainment venues, especially in areas such as Roppongi and Kabuki-cho, near Shinjuku, has led to robbery, physical and sexual assaults, and credit card fraud.  Some victims regain consciousness in the bar or club; other victims may awaken on the street or other unfamiliar locations. U.S. citizens have reported being threatened with gun or knife violence in such venues so that they will pay exorbitant bar tabs or withdraw money.  U.S. citizens have also reported being beaten when they have refused to pay or hand over money. There have been reports of U.S. citizens being forcibly taken to ATMs and robbed, or made to withdraw funds after being unable to pay exorbitant bar tabs. Please be aware that Roppongi, Kabuki-cho, and other entertainment and nightlife districts have also been the scenes of violence between criminal syndicates.  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.  Police reports must be filed at the nearest police station prior to departure from Japan. The Japanese police cannot accept reports filed from overseas. Report crimes to the local police at 110 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 03-3224-5000 (011-81-3-3224-5000 from overseas).

Contacting Police, Fire and Ambulance Services: You can reach the police throughout Japan by dialing 110. Fire and ambulance services can be contacted by dialing 119.  Note that English-speaking dispatchers may not be available. Please review advice on \u201cCalling for Help\u201d on our website. If you need assistance, you should be able to describe your address/location in Japanese or find someone who can do so, since few police officers speak English. Domestic Violence: Victim's assistance resources or battered women's shelters exist in major urban areas, but are difficult for foreigners to access. These types of resources are also generally unavailable in rural areas.

Frequently, their aim is unprotected and/or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: The most common crimes encountered by foreign visitors are purse snatching, pickpocketing, assaults, and robberies, although all of these incidents are rare. Be vigilant and do not carry large sums of money or valuables on the street. Financial fraud, such as ATM skimming, is prevalent. The police sometimes conduct identification checks in public areas. Police are not required to demonstrate probable cause to detain individuals. Upon request, you must produce either a passport or an Embassy or Consulate-certified copy of your passport. Kazakh security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms and telephones may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. Harassment and extortion by imposters, genuine law enforcement, and other officials does occur. Never voluntarily give your wallet to anybody. If pressured by a police officer, tell the officer that you will report the behavior to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate and to the officer\u2019s supervisors. Try to obtain the officer's name, badge number, and license plate number, and note where and when the incident happened. Do not use unmarked taxis. At the airport, do not leave with anyone who does not show pre-arranged identification, even if the person is holding a sign with your name. The U.S. Mission in Kazakhstan is aware of isolated incidents when foreigners have been drugged, robbed, and physically assaulted at bars and nightclubs as well as in unmarked taxis. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance.

    "Safety and Security": "You should review the Department of State\u2019s Travel Advisory for Kenya before considering travel to Kenya. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are using increasingly less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Terrorist threats remain high in Kenya. Terrorist attacks in Kenya have cumulatively resulted in the death and injury of hundreds of people, including foreigners. Attacks have occurred in periods leading up to and during religious holidays and days of national significance. However, an attack is possible at any time. Please note these recent events: In January 2020, terrorists attacked a U.S. Department of Defense facility on the coast, killing several individuals and destroying seven aircraft. In January 2019, a small bomb exploded in Nairobi\u2019s Central Business District, slightly injuring two people. In January 2019, a terrorist attack on the Dusit D2 Hotel complex in the Westlands area of Nairobi resulted in the death of 21 people, including one U.S. citizen. In April 2019, two Cuban doctors were kidnapped from a rural area in Mandera County and were reportedly transported to Somalia. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Regions to Avoid: The northeastern Kenyan counties of Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, and the northeastern area of Marsabit (including the cities of El Wak, Wajir, Garissa, Mandera, Moyale, and Liboi). All parts of the coastal counties of Tana River and Lamu, and all areas of Kilifi County north of Malindi. The road between Kainuk and Lodwar in Turkana County due to banditry. The Nairobi neighborhoods of Eastleigh and Kibera. Avoid using the Likoni ferry due to safety and security concerns. Crime: Crime in Kenya is a regular occurrence and Kenyan authorities have limited capacity to deter and investigate such acts. Violent and sometimes fatal criminal attacks, including home invasions, burglaries, armed carjackings, muggings, and kidnappings can occur at any time. \u201cMatatus\u201d (privately-operated public transportation buses) tend to be targeted since they carry multiple passengers. Cases of violent street crime targeting Westerners occur in many seemingly safe areas of Nairobi, ranging from simple muggings to kidnapping and extortion, including attacks during daylight hours. U.S. citizens using off-the-street taxis have also been victims of robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. Forced Marriage is known to occur in Kenya. Female genital mutilation (FGM) and Cutting (C): This act is known to occur in Kenya. It is a federal crime to perform FGM/C in the United States on any minor younger than 18 years old, punishable by fines and up to five years in prison. It is also a criminal offense knowingly to take a minor younger than 18 years old outside of the United States for the purpose of performing FGM/C (so-called \u201cvacation cutting\u201d). Sexual Assault is prevalent in Kenya and frequently goes unreported. Victims of sexual assault may have difficulty receiving adequate social or medical support. While sexual assault is mostly frequently associated with women, sexual assault of men also occurs in Kenya and often goes unreported because of the stigma attached to this type of assault. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Kenya. Scams are often initiated through dating apps, internet postings/profiles, or by unsolicited emails and letters. Common scams include: Romance and online dating (Check this online dating scam infographic). Someone you have not met in person quickly offers friendship, romance, and/or marriage. Job solicitations asking for a processing fee in advance. A person asking for money to pay hospital bills, visa fees, or legal expenses and/or seeming to have many sudden problems overseas. Elaborate scam business opportunities, including fraudulent government procurements. Recently, scammers have been impersonating legitimate companies and ordering commodities shipped through Mombasa with payment terms. Companies are encouraged to independently verify the purchasing company to confirm the order prior to shipping goods without pre-payment. Please contact the Commercial Section at Office.Nairobi@trade.gov for assistance verifying procurement opportunities and Kenyan buyers. Use good judgement and caution on social media and dating websites. If you decide to meet someone in person that you have connected with online, be sure to set up the meeting in a safe and public place, and let someone know where you are. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 999, 112 or 911, and contact the U.S. Embassy during business hours at +254 (0) 20-363-6451, or after-hours at +254 (0) 20-363-6000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Kenya has assistance programs for victims of crime sponsored by nongovernmental organizations. These programs include but are not limited to the following: Gender Violence Recovery Centre (GVRC) Gender Violence Recovery Centre (GVRC) has been providing specialized medical treatment and psychosocial support to low-income survivors of sexual and domestic violence. Healthcare Assistance Kenya (HAK) offers a 24-hour Rapid Response Service to women and children survivors of Gender Based Violence at its Call Centre as well as a 24 hour toll-free hotline for sexual and gender based violence assistance. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The Kenyan Tourism Regulatory Authority has oversight for the country\u2019s tourism sector. The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities vary by region. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Game parks and related safari tours with well-established operators generally have been reported to be safe."

    "country_name": "Lebanon",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism:  Across the world, terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad and resort to various methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles  \u2013 frequently on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) In Lebanon, there is potential for death or injury because of terrorist attacks. Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Lebanon. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Lebanon. U.S. citizens have been the targets of terrorist attacks in Lebanon. The threat of anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders. Clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal elements continue to occur in areas of the Bekaa Valley and border regions.  Hizballah maintains a strong presence in the Bekaa Valley, in addition to areas in southern Lebanon and south Beirut. In addition to the threat of Hizballah conducted terrorist activity, Hizballah has been the target of attacks by other extremist groups for their support of the Assad regime in Syria. Avoid the Lebanon-Syria border region: The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region because of past clashes, extremist activity, and the potential for these to recur at any time. Avoid the Lebanon-Israel border region: Hostilities flared in Southern Lebanon in April 2022, and again in April 2023, due to tensions between Israel, Hizballah, and the Palestinian terrorist group HAMAS. The potential for wider conflict remains. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanon-Israel border area due to ongoing tensions between the two countries. Attacks and responses can occur without warning. Landmines and unexploded ordnance pose significant dangers throughout southern Lebanon, particularly south of the Litani River. Travelers should watch for posted landmine warnings and strictly avoid all marked areas. Avoid travel to refugee settlements: Violence within refugee settlements has resulted in shootings and explosions. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to refugee settlements. Palestinian groups hostile to both the Lebanese government and the United States operate autonomously in formal and informal refugee settlements in different areas of the country. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Reported crime rates in Lebanon are moderate but rising. Violent crime and sexual assault are rare but do occur. Petty theft -- such as pickpocketing and purse snatching -- occurs in crowded public areas. More recently, the dire economic situation is engendering a significant increase in economically motivated crimes, including home invasions and car thefts. Police are responsive but often unable to affect a positive outcome. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Protests often occur spontaneously with little to no advance warning. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Lebanon. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

    "Safety and Security": "Liberia's police force has limited resources. The Liberia National Police have a strong presence in Monrovia, but less of a presence outside of the capital city. The police can be both a source of assistance and a source of problems for visitors. Travelers may be detained by police officers soliciting bribes. You are encouraged to carry a photocopy of your passport with you at all times as proof of identity and citizenship. If detained or arrested, you should ask to contact the U.S. Embassy immediately. You should be aware of your surroundings at all times and use caution when moving around, especially at night. Travel outside of Monrovia after dark is strongly discouraged, as roads are in poor condition and there are few public street lights. U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling outside the capital or between counties after dark (with the exception of travel to and from Roberts International Airport). Avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness. Crime: Crimes of opportunity, such as residential burglary or armed robbery (typically using a knife or machete) have affected U.S. citizens and are more common at night. Criminal activity has been reported in both urban and rural areas, including public beaches. The Liberia National Police have limited capacity to respond to crime events. The local equivalent to the \u201c911\u201d emergency line in Liberia is also 911. However, emergency services are not provided reliably or consistently. Also, there is no landline telephone service in Liberia, and cellular phone communication is subject to occasional disruptions in service. A call to 911 in Liberia may go unanswered, and you should employ other resources to obtain emergency assistance. Corruption: Corruption is rampant. Poorly paid government officials and private company employees may ask for \u201cfees\u201d for doing their job, and travelers may be inconvenienced for not paying bribes. Requesting official signed receipts for the payment of any unexpected \u201cfines\u201d or \u201cfees\u201d can sometimes deter such improper behavior. Demonstrations\u202foccur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.\u202fWhile infrequent, the police may use tear gas. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Scams: Internet romance and financial scams occur in Liberia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical assistance as needed and contact the U.S. Embassy as soon as possible.  Report crimes to the local police in person or at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (231) 77-677-7000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

If in Libya, make contingency emergency plans and maintain situational awareness at all times. Terrorist Threats: Extremist groups seek to target U.S. government officials, citizens, and interests in Libya. Terrorists may also target areas perceived to be frequented by Westerners, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, businesses, transportation hubs, foreign embassies, expatriate residential areas, and schools. The following groups, including those on the U.S. government\u2019s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, pose a high risk to U.S. citizens in the region: The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) Al-Qa\u2019ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi (AAS-B) Ansar al-Sharia in Dernah (AAS-D) Recent terrorist attacks have occurred in Libya and the surrounding region. Extremists have kidnapped foreigners. Please note the country pages for neighboring countries, Algeria, Tunisia, Chad, Niger, Sudan, and Egypt. Clashes among armed groups, including government-aligned forces, occur regularly throughout the country, including Tripoli, other urban areas. Militia: Militia-controlled checkpoints are common, including in many parts of Tripoli. Militia groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary or unclear reasons, without access to a lawyer or legal process. The Department of State has extremely limited capacity to assist U.S. citizens who are detained by militia groups. Airports, seaports, and roads can close with little or no warning. Maritime Security: Violence against civilian commercial interests has escalated, creating serious safety concerns for maritime vessels and their crews. The \u201cLibyan National Army\u201d (LNA), a non-state armed group based in eastern Libya, announced on January 7, 2015, that all vessels in Libyan waters require LNA approval for transit. U.S. mariners are advised to exercise extreme caution while transiting in or near Libyan territorial waters. Vessels are advised to proceed with extreme caution when approaching all Libyan oil terminals and ports. Follow the recommendations in the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s Port Security Advisory 1-14 issued April 1, 2014.

European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Demonstrations occur occasionally in Luxembourg and have historically been non-violent. Public demonstrations take place for a variety of political, economic, or social causes. Demonstrations tend to take place on politically significant days and during international summits hosted in the country. Demonstrations tend to be small, well organized and non-violent, and generally sanctioned in advance by local officials. However, even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates on the situation and traffic advisories. Alerts issued regarding demonstrations are now posted on the U.S. Mission\u2019s website. Crime: Thefts of backpacks, laptops, or other valuables regularly occur on the trains with notably more incidents on the trains to and from Brussels. Although overall crime has decreased in recent years, home burglaries have increased with the highest number of incidents occurring during the Christmas season and summer holidays when residents are likely to be on vacation or out of the house. Low-level drug vending has increased in some of Luxembourg\u2019s city parks at night and around the main train station in Luxembourg City. Incidents of petty crime spike during the annual \u201cSchueberfouer,\u201d a three-week fair held in Luxembourg City every summer.

    "country_name": "Madagascar",
    "Safety and Security": "Civil unrest, such as protests, is common in Madagascar. Be especially vigilant in the vicinity of downtown Antananarivo especially near government buildings, the national stadium, and historical monuments, where violent incidents have occurred. Violent confrontations between the dahalo (criminal gangs that steal cattle) and security forces have increased in several regions of Madagascar, particularly in areas south and west of the capital. Often precipitated by rumors or allegations of injuries to local citizens especially in areas where there are minimal security forces, mob violence and \u201cpopular justice\u201d continues but is rarely directed toward foreign nationals. Street altercations and traffic accidents often quickly draw large and sometimes unruly crowds. Exercise caution and remain calm if you find yourself in a dispute, particularly in a public place. If you feel threatened by large crowds, immediately leave the scene, seek the direct intervention of local law enforcement, and contact the U.S. Embassy. The cyclone season in Madagascar occurs between December and April. Please monitor media reports, the RSMC Tropical Cyclone Center, and follow all official instructions. Exercise Increased Caution Due to Possible Protests and Civil Unrest Related to Presidential Election The official campaign season for Madagascar\u2019s presidential election has begun. The first round of voting is scheduled for November 16. A second round, if necessary, is scheduled for December 20. Opposition candidates have already called for and staged large-scale protests in the capital, Antananarivo, resulting in violent confrontations with law enforcement. Such protests may continue throughout the election period and may escalate and expand geographically as the candidates begin to campaign throughout the country. Given the increased possibility of protests and civil unrest, we urge U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution and enroll in STEP to ensure access to security alerts sent by the Embassy. We also advise U.S. citizens that domestic flights in Madagascar are frequently subject to last-minute cancellations that can leave travelers stranded in remote areas without assistance. Tsaradia, Madagascar\u2019s state-owned domestic airline, has a monopoly on domestic commercial flights and is notorious for last-minute cancellations and rescheduling, with no recourse for stranded travelers. Those who book Tsaradia flights through a third-party may not receive any advance notice of such cancellations and rescheduling. Regional airports in Madagascar receive little traffic and will close completely if the Tsaradia flight(s) for the day is cancelled. In such an event, there are no airline personnel present to assist stranded travelers. We recommend that travelers make contingency plans for lodging and local transportation in case their flight is cancelled or rescheduled at the last minute. CRIME: Petty crime in Madagascar is common in urban areas. Skilled pickpockets are very active in downtown Antananarivo, and they primarily target jewelry, purses, and mobile phones. Additionally, criminals have stolen luggage from baggage claim areas at Antananarivo\u2019s Ivato International Airport by simply grabbing items off the conveyor belt and exiting the airport. Serious crimes, including home invasions, armed attacks, robberies, and assaults, are common in Madagascar. U.S. Embassy personnel are instructed not to use taxi-bes (minibuses which operate within urban centers) and taxi-brousses (which travel to outlying regions) due to the risk of carjacking and highway robbery. The majority of reported crimes were directed at Malagasy nationals but Westerners have likewise been targeted. Avoid walking alone especially after dark. Do not display cash and valuables. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Always carry a color photocopy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location. Most Malagasy authorities will accept a color photo copy, but you may be requested to present the original. Violent crime, such as armed robbery and assaults, is common in: Toamasina and Mahajanga Nosy Be Ankarana and Montagne d\u2019Ambre National Parks adjacent to Diego Isalo area surrounding Tolagnaro (Ft. Dauphin) Batteie Beach, north of Toliara (Tul\u00e9ar) Visiting remote sites: While the government has increased the number of dedicated police units at popular tourist sites, only visit remote sites in large groups guided by reputable tour operators. Exercise caution when traveling through these designated areas due to violent highway robberies: The general area south of the National Route (RN) 7 and RN 27 including the RN 10, RN 13, and the surrounding areas. Except the tourist area on the coastal roads between Ambovombe and Farafangana, including Fort Dauphin/Tolagnaro area. The RN 1B, which is located to the west of Antananarivo between Tsiroanomandidy and Maintirano. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.

They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays or election dates, or during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Looting is common along protest routes. Be aware of tear gas and other riot control measures. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Both spontaneous and planned civil disturbances and demonstrations, primarily related to governance and economic issues, can occur. U.S. citizens should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness at all times.  CRIME: Crime is common in Malawi. Most crimes against U.S. citizens involve property. Residential break-ins are frequent; perpetrators are usually well armed and may become violent with little provocation. Petty street crime (robbery and pickpocketing) is common, and break-ins have occurred in hotels and lodges throughout the country. Kidnappings occur and non-Malawians have been targeted in Zomba. Carjackings occur, especially in Lilongwe and Blantyre. Carjackers often block the rear of a victim\u2019s vehicle while it waits to pass through a security gate into a residence and then assailants threaten the driver and take the car. Victims are often assaulted. Drivers are advised to lock their car doors, close their windows, and remain vigilant when entering or exiting a residence. When traveling, ensure your windows are up and doors are locked. You should avoid traveling on foot at night, especially in urban areas, as armed muggings and assaults have occurred. Non-Malawians have been targeted in Lilongwe, and several U.S. citizens have been injured. City streets should be considered unsafe after dark even when walking in a large group. Pedestrians should also be cautious during daylight hours. Visitors in need of transportation should request that hotel or restaurant management call a taxi or car service. The capacity and availability of public security forces is limited, we recommend you use caution when visiting and/or especially when staying in less populated areas such as the Mount Mulanje region . You should take appropriate action to ensure your safety if traveling to remote areas, and never travel alone or at night. Ensure you are communicating with a friend or family member as to your whereabouts while traveling in Malawi, as cell phone reception is limited in many areas.

    "country_name": "Malaysia",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)  Malaysia remains a transit point and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for members of terrorist groups including ISIS, Abu Sayyaf Group, al-Qa\u2019ida, and Jemaah Islamiyah. Information from credible sources suggests that there is a continued risk of armed terrorist and criminal groups operating and planning attacks against foreigners, including U.S. citizens, in the East Asian and Pacific region, including Malaysia. Since 2013, Malaysian authorities have arrested more than 500 supporters of ISIS, including many individuals who planned to fight in Syria and Iraq. Use caution in eastern Sabah because of the threat of kidnappings-for-ransom and violence from both terrorist and criminal groups, including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf Group (see the Philippines Travel Advisory for more information). In addition to targeting coastal or resort islands themselves, criminal or terrorist groups may attempt to intercept boats ferrying tourists from the mainland to resort islands.  Due to safety concerns, U.S. government employees traveling for both personal and official travel to Sabah east of the north-south line drawn from the cities of Kudat to Tawau, including all islands, must obtain official written permission from the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. The exceptions are the cities of Sandakan, Lahad Datu, Tawau, the Sepiloolik Nature Reserve, and the Kinabatangan River areas, which require U.S. government employees to officially notify the Embassy prior to travel. Malaysian law enforcement officials have enacted land and water-based curfews in the coastal areas of eastern Sabah. Check local media or ask local police for the most recent curfew information if traveling to eastern Sabah. For more information, see our Terrorism page.   Crime:  Petty theft and violent crime in Kuala Lumpur continue to be concerns. Purse snatchings, pickpocketing, smash-and-grab thefts from vehicles, and residential burglaries are the most common crimes committed against both locals and foreigners. Avoid wrapping purse straps around arms or shoulders to avoid injury. Violent and more serious crimes are less common; however, in October 2022, following local media reports of an increase in violent crime in the area of 430-440 Jalan Tun Razak, which houses multiple bars, clubs, and restaurants, the Embassy has advised U.S. government employees visiting establishments in this general vicinity to depart the neighborhood no later than 9:00 pm. Taxi drivers in central Kuala Lumpur have perpetrated violent crimes against foreign tourists and local residents. Use e-hailing services or book taxis in downtown shopping areas by phone or online, rather than hailing a taxi on the street, particularly after dark. Criminals also target motorists stuck in traffic or stopped at a light with smash and grab robberies. Keep valuables out of sight while driving or remove them from the car (including from the trunk) when parked. GPS devices should not be left on the windshield or dashboard. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.   Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Local law pertaining to peaceful assembly prohibits non-Malaysians from participating in public protests. International Financial Scams:\u202f See the\u202fDepartment of State\u202fand the\u202fFBI\u202fpages for information.  Sophisticated internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Malaysia.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or less frequently, or by unsolicited emails, and letters, text messages, and messages on social media.  Scammers almost alwaysfrequently pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include:    Romance/Online dating  Money transfers  Lucrative sales  Gold purchase  Contracts with promises of large commissions  Inheritance notices  Work permits/job offers  Bank overpayments Digital/cryptocurrency scams Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police via the emergency line at 999 (landline) or 112 (cell/mobile). Alternatively, call the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) Operations Center in Kuala Lumpur, 03-2115-9999 or 03-2266-2222 for advice on how to make a non-emergency police report.   Contact the U.S. Embassy at +(60) (3) 2168-5000.  A police report is necessary for the eEmbassy to help victims follow up on incidents of crime.  In some tourist areas, the police have established small \"Tourist Police\u201d stations manned by personnel familiar with helping visitors to Malaysia.

Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance, and first responder capabilities may vary.  When participating in trekking or other activities in extremely remote areas, particularly in the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo, it may be difficult for first responders to reach patients quickly.

There are no reports of unrest or demonstrations on the resort islands or at Ibrahim Nasir International Airport. Travelers should not engage in political activity in Maldives. Visitors should exercise caution, particularly at night, and should steer clear of demonstrations and spontaneous gatherings. Those who encounter demonstrations or large crowds should avoid confrontation, remain calm, and depart the area quickly.  While traveling in Maldives, travelers should refer to news sources, check the U.S. Embassy Colombo website for possible security updates, and remain aware of their surroundings at all times.  U.S. Embassy employees are not resident in Maldives. This will constrain the Embassy\u2019s ability to provide services to U.S. citizens in an emergency. Many tourist resorts are several hours\u2019 distance from Mal\u00e9 by boat, necessitating lengthy response times by authorities in case of medical or criminal emergencies.  Crime: Maldives has a moderate crime rate, although crime on resort islands is rare. Valuables may be stolen when left unattended on beaches or in hotels. Drug use is on the rise among young Maldivians and the penalty for drug use is severe. The capital city of Mal\u00e9 saw a spate of gang violence in August 2014, with several attacks involving the use of edged weapons. Gang activity and gang violence in Mal\u00e9 appears to be on the rise   See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, you should contact the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  The local equivalent to the \u201c911\u201d emergency line in Maldives is 119. Note: This number is only for the police, not for emergency medical services.

    "country_name": "Mali",
    "Safety and Security": "Read the Department of State\u2019s Travel Advisory for Mali and Worldwide Caution before planning travel to Mali. Lawlessness and Instability: Mali faces significant security challenges. A disparate group of militias, bandits, politically motivated armed groups, and extremists exert influence in wide swathes of northern and central Mali. Malian state presence\u2014including law enforcement, schools, and other public services\u2014generally does not exist in those areas outside of major cities. The northern parts of the country continue to be plagued by insecurity due to terrorism and ongoing military operations, while  central Mali--in the Segou and Mopti Regions--is unstable due to violent intercommunal conflict, instigated by terrorist groups, and armed attacks. Terrorism: Travelers should avoid travel outside of Bamako because of insecurity and ongoing military operations. Terrorist groups with varying degrees of allegiance to al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) operate in Mali and often pursue local agendas complementary to these global jihadist movements. Groups linked with al-Qa\u2019ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which have merged under the banner of Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), remain active and routinely conduct attacks targeting international and Malian military forces. These groups have claimed responsibility for small arms and improvised explosive attacks, kidnappings, and other violent actions, including attacks on the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). French troops, in collaboration with Malian security forces, conduct counterterrorism operations that target extremist elements. However, these foreign forces\u2019 presence is not sufficient to counter every threat. Attacks by violent Islamist extremist groups have spread beyond the traditional conflict zone in the north to the center and south of the country. The area along the border with Burkina Faso and some remote parts of southern Mali are increasingly under threat of attack. In Bamako, hotels, restaurants, and other areas where Westerners congregate may be targeted by extremists. On June 18, 2017 terrorists attacked Hotel Kangaba, a popular destination for westerners and expatriates on the outskirts of Bamako, killing five civilians and one Malian first responder.   Kidnapping: The threat of kidnapping of Westerners by criminal or terrorist groups remains high throughout the region. Extortion and kidnapping for ransom are significant sources of financing for JNIM-affiliated groups. In one exchange in 2020, JNIM released four hostages, including a Malian politician and three Westerners, for the release of some 200 prisoners held by Malian authorities. JNIM had executed another Western hostage shortly before the exchange. Travel Restrictions for U.S. Government Employees: U.S. government employees must seek permission before traveling outside of Bamako. They are also prohibited from using public transportation outside of Bamako. Although these restrictions do not apply to private U.S. citizens, you should take them into account when traveling in Mali. Civil Unrest: Periodic street demonstrations occur throughout Mali. Although some are planned and peaceful, demonstrations can occur spontaneously and turn violent. The majority of these are contained by security forces, but U.S. citizens should avoid street demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Mali also has been subject to periodic coups, the most recent of which occurred in August 2020. Crime: Criminal traffickers of all kinds operate throughout the Sahel and may respond violently if encountered. Violent crimes are frequent; U.S. citizens should maintain a vigilant posture in all urban areas. There has been a recent uptick in police harassment and violent crime such as armed robbery, armed carjacking, and assault in Bamako. There are sporadic reports of nighttime robberies occurring on the roads outside of the capital; tourists should not drive at night (See Travel & Transportation section). For Your Safety: Guard your passport and wallet when in crowded outdoor areas and open-air markets. You may wish to consider carrying only paper copies of your passport and documents in these areas. Be vigilant for pickpockets, especially at night. Use all available safety measures in your home or hotel, including locking doors and windows at all times, as well as employing an alarm system. If asked to stop by police, stop only in well-lit areas or places where several officers are posted. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy. Report crimes to the local police at 80 00-11 25 (connection and response is not always reliable) and contact the U.S. Embassy during normal consular hours at (+223) 20 70 23 00, or after-hours at (+223) 66 75 28 60. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. However, response from local authorities and recourse for victims of crime is extremely limited. When you do interact with local police, always request a copy of the police report. Due to the vigilantism which often occurs when criminals are apprehended in Mali, it is best to avoid the large crowds that may gather at the scene of a crime, a vehicle accident, or any altercation. Please see our information for victims of crime, including help for U.S. victims of crime overseas, and possible victim compensation programs in the United States. The U.S. Embassy can: help you find appropriate medical care assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the United States_ provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution help you find accommodation and arrange flights home replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Malta\u2019s open borders with members of the Schengen zone allow the possibility of individual terrorists entering/exiting the country undetected. CRIME: The most commonly reported crimes are simple assault, pick-pocketing, and petty theft. While armed robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides are not as common as in some major U.S. cities, they do occur. Criminals focus on areas and establishments frequented by tourists. Secure your valuables, and be aware of pick-pockets and purse snatchers. Theft of unattended property is a very common problem. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Nightclubs: You should be careful in the Paceville nightclub area, where excessive drinking, large crowds, and interaction with heavy-handed bouncers can lead to violence, including some that appears to be racially-motivated. Criminals have drugged some travelers at bars and robbed and assaulted them. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+356) 2561-4000.

The most common crimes are break-ins and thefts from homes, hotel rooms, and vehicles, as well as occasional random acts of vandalism. Keep your hotel room or residence locked at all times. The number of violent assaults has increased over the past few years, however, including three homicides. Occasionally, fights and assaults occur at nightclubs and bars. If you visit those establishments, especially late in the evening, be extra vigilant to ensure your personal security. Use caution when driving or walking on the roads late at night as drunk driving is prevalent and there are no sidewalks and little to no room on the sides of roads for pedestrians to walk. All taxis in Majuro are shared taxis that stop to pick up and drop off passengers frequently. There have been reports of taxi drivers and/or passengers sexually harassing women in shared taxis.

    "country_name": "Mauritania",
    "Safety and Security": "Read the Department of State\u2019s Travel Advisory for Mauritania and Worldwide Caution before planning travel to Mauritania. Terrorism: The U.S. government assesses that a credible terrorist threat against foreigners remains in Mauritania. U.S. citizens in Mauritania should take precautions, remain vigilant, and be alert to local security developments. Travel in Mauritania is discouraged, particularly in the easternmost region, due to activities by terrorist groups including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which are active in the neighboring regions of Mali. Traveling safely within Mauritania: You should exercise prudence and caution when traveling in Mauritania. Be particularly vigilant when traveling by road outside of populated areas. The U.S. Embassy discourages travel outside of urban areas unless in a convoy accompanied by an experienced guide, and even then only if equipped with sturdy vehicles and ample provisions. Nighttime driving should be avoided. Travel at night between cities in Mauritania is prohibited for U.S. Embassy staff and all driving outside of the capital of Nouakchott requires a minimum two vehicle convoy. Landmines remain a danger along the border with the Western Sahara and travelers should cross only at designated border posts. Political concerns: Protests and political rallies occur frequently in Mauritania, and can sometimes turn violent. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid political rallies and street demonstrations. Crime: Criminal activity in Nouakchott continues to rise. A number of homes and private individuals, including U.S. citizens, have recently been targeted by violent criminals. In Nouakchott, armed robberies and burglaries are occurring at homes as well as on busy streets in broad daylight. Some of these incidents have been violent, and the use of knives and other weapons is becoming more common. Because of the increase in criminal activity, U.S. Embassy staff and their family members are prohibited from walking alone outside of designated areas and times. U.S. citizens have been victims of assaults, including sexual assaults. Given the lack of government regulation of taxi fares and poor regular maintenance, U.S. citizens should avoid taxis and public transportation. U.S. Embassy staff and their family members are prohibited from using public transportation and local taxi services. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy.

    "Safety and Security": "Precautions: Keep valuables locked in a hotel room safe. Be aware of surroundings, especially at night. Avoid demonstrations. Even events intended to be peaceful can turn violent. Maintain caution at public gatherings and areas frequented by foreigners. Follow the instructions of local authorities, monitor local media, and the Embassy\u2019s Facebook page and Website. Crime: Most criminal activity directed against foreigners is non-violent. Non-violent crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing, purse snatchings, and petty thefts, occur in crowded outdoor shopping areas, including areas that cater to the robust tourist industry, and have occurred near ATMs. Tourists should be alert for petty scams by street vendors and inflated \u201ctourist prices\u201d in markets. Women walking by themselves may be at greater risk for verbal harassment and criminal targeting. Individual violent crimes (serious assaults, murder, rape) are known to occur.

    "country_name": "Mexico",
    "Safety and Security": "Travelers are urged to review the Mexico Travel Advisory for information about safety and security concerns affecting the country on a state-by-state basis. U.S. citizens traveling to and residing in Mexico should not expect public health and safety standards like those in the United States. Even where such standards exist, enforcement varies by location. Travelers should mitigate the risk of illness or injury by taking standard health and safety precautions. The phone number to report emergencies in Mexico is \u201c911.\u201d Although there may be English-speaking operators available, it is best to seek the assistance of a Spanish speaker to place the call. Crime: Crime in Mexico occurs at a high rate and can be violent, from random street crime to cartel-related attacks. Over the past year, Mission Mexico has assisted U.S. citizens who were victims of armed robbery, carjacking, extortion, homicide, kidnapping, pick-pocketing, and sexual assault. Increased levels of cartel-related violence have resulted in territorial disputes and targeted killings, injuring or killing innocent bystanders. Travelers who find themselves in an active shooter scenario should flee in the opposite direction, if possible, or drop to the ground, preferably behind a hard barrier. Drivers on roads and highways may encounter government checkpoints, which often include National Guard or military personnel. State and local police also set up checkpoints in and around cities and along the highways to deter criminal activity and enforce traffic laws. In some parts of Mexico, criminal organizations and other non-governmental actors have been known to erect unauthorized checkpoints and have abducted or threatened violence against those who fail to stop and/or pay a \u201ctoll.\u201d When approaching a checkpoint, regardless of whether it is official, cooperate and avoid any actions that may appear suspicious or aggressive. While Mexican authorities endeavor to safeguard the country\u2019s major resort areas and tourist destinations, those areas have not been immune to the types of violence and crime experienced elsewhere in Mexico. In some areas of Mexico, response time of local police is often slow. In addition, filing police reports can be time consuming. See our Mexico Travel Advisory for more information. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Protesters in Mexico may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares, or take control of toll booths on highways.  Travelers who encounter protesters who demand unofficial tolls are generally allowed to pass upon payment.  U.S. citizens should avoid participating in demonstrations or other activities that might be deemed political by authorities, as Mexican law prohibits political activities by foreign citizens and such actions may result in detention or deportation. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.   Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.   International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.   Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Mexico. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:    Romance/Online dating  Money transfers  Lucrative sales  Grandparent/Relative targeting  Free Trip/Luggage  Inheritance notices  Bank overpayments  Mexico\u2019s consumer protection agency, PROFECO (Procuradur\u00eda Federal del Consumidor, Spanish only), can sometimes provide assistance (Spanish only) to victims of such scams. In addition, there have been allegations of banking fraud perpetrated by private bankers against U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens who believe they have been victims of fraud can file a police report file a complaint (Spanish only) with the Mexican banking regulatory agency, CONDUSEF (Comision Nacional para la Proteccion y Defensa de los Usuarios de Servicios Financieros, Spanish only), or consult with an attorney. Victims of Crime: U.S. victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate for assistance.  Report emergencies to the local police at 911, report crimes already committed to the Ministerio Publico, and contact the Embassy or Consulate at +52-55-85262561.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. U.S. citizen victims of crime should contact the local authorities to file a Mexican police report before departing Mexico. In most instances, victims of crime will file reports with the Ministerio Publico (equivalent to the office of public prosecutor or district attorney in the United States) and not with police first responders. U.S. citizens should also inform the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate.  See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.  We can: help you find appropriate medical care, assist you in reporting a crime to the police, contact relatives or friends with your written consent, provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion,  provide a list of local attorneys, provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the United States, provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution, help you find accommodation and arrange flights home, replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate for assistance. Kidnapping: Mexico experiences very high rates of kidnapping.  If you believe you or your U.S. citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) relative has been kidnapped, please contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate immediately. Robbery: Mexico experiences robberies, typically in cities, in which abductors force victims to use their debit or credit card to withdraw money from ATMs in exchange for their release. Perpetrators commonly work in cooperation with, or pose as, taxi drivers. To minimize the risk of such robberies: Only use a reputable taxi company or a trusted ride-sharing app. Book taxis through your hotel or an authorized taxi stand. Extortion: Extortion schemes are common in Mexico.  In a typical scheme known as a virtual kidnapping, criminals convince family members that a relative has been abducted, when, in fact, the person is safe but unreachable.  The purported abductors will often use threats to persuade victims to isolate themselves, making communication with family members less likely.  Unable to reach their loved ones, family members often consent to paying the \u201cransom\u201d demand.  Criminals use various means to gather information about potential victims, including monitoring social media sites, eavesdropping on conversations, or using information taken from a stolen cell phone.  Some of these extortions have been conducted from Mexican prisons.  You can reduce the risk of falling victim to this type of extortion through the following: Do not discuss travel plans, your room number, or any other personal information within earshot of strangers. Do not divulge personal business details to strangers in person or over the phone, especially when using hotel phones. If you are threatened on the phone, hang up immediately. Sexual Assault: Rape and sexual assault are serious problems in some resort areas. Many of these incidents occur at night or during the early morning hours, in hotel rooms, on hotel grounds, or on deserted beaches. In some cases, assailants drug the drinks of victims before assaulting them. Pay attention to your surroundings and to who might have handled your drink. Credit/Debit Card \u201cSkimming:\u201d There have been instances of fraudulent charges or withdrawals from accounts due to \u201cskimmed\u201d cards. If you choose to use credit or debit cards, you should regularly check your account to ensure there are no unauthorized transactions. Travelers should limit the amount of cash they carry in public, exercise caution when withdrawing cash from ATMs, and avoid ATMs located in isolated or unlit areas. Alcohol: If you choose to drink alcohol, it is important to do so in moderation and to stop and seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. There have been reports of individuals falling ill or blacking out after consuming unregulated alcohol. The Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk, COFEPRIS (Comision Federal para la Proteccion contra Riesgos Sanitarios, Spanish only), is responsible for inspecting hotels, restaurants, and other establishments for health violations, including reports of unregulated alcohol. Please email COFEPRIS at contactociudadano@cofepris.gob.mx for more information or if you wish to file a report. You can file a report online (Spanish only) via the COFEPRIS website, by calling the COFEPRIS call center at 800 033 50 50 (from Mexico) or +52 (55) 5080-5425 (from the United States), or by scheduling an appointment (Spanish only) to visit a COFEPRIS office. There have also been instances of criminals drugging drinks to rob or sexually assault victims. Additionally, if you feel you have been the victim of unregulated alcohol or another serious health violation, you should notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate. You may also contact the U.S. Department of State \u2013 Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, D.C. at 1-888-407-4747 (toll-free in the United States and Canada) or 1-202-501-4444 (from all other countries). Drug Smuggling: Mexican criminal organizations are engaged in a violent struggle to control trafficking routes. Criminal organizations smuggling drugs into the United States have targeted unsuspecting individuals who regularly cross the border. Frequent border crossers are advised to vary their routes and travel times and to closely monitor their vehicles to avoid being targeted. Tourism: In major cities and resort areas, the tourism industry is generally well-regulated.  Best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas and activities are identified with appropriate signage, and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and/or provide life-saving assistance.  In smaller towns and areas less commonly frequented by foreign tourists, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  Since 2016, Mexico has opened seven multilingual Centers for the Care and Protection of Tourists (CAPTA) and Tourist Assistance Centers (CATTAC) in Los Cabos, La Paz, Acapulco, Playa del Carmen, Mazatlan, Ciudad Madero, and Queretaro. These offices have proven helpful assisting U.S. citizen visitors in resolving disputes with merchants and government entities, filing criminal reports, securing needed services, and locating special needs accommodations."

    "Safety and Security": "Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Police have the legal right to ask for identification on the street. Carry your passport or a photocopy of it at all times. If a police officer stops you, ask to see his or her identity card (\u201clegiti-MAT-seeya\u201d in Romanian, which is the official language in Moldova.). Moldovan police have the word \u201cPOLITIA\u201d printed on the backs of their uniforms. Traffic police should also display a metal badge on the outside of their uniforms. If a police officer harasses you or asks for a bribe, try to record the officer\u2019s name, title, badge number, and physical description. Contact the U.S. Embassy to report the incident at the earliest opportunity. Transnistria Region:  Transnistria is a breakaway region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government in Chisinau.  Visitors may encounter difficulties at checkpoints along roads leading into and out of Transnistria.  Taking photographs of military facilities and security forces is prohibited and may result in trouble with de facto authorities. The U.S. government\u2019s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria maybe be limited or delayed since Transnistria\u2019s de facto authorities control access to the region. Crime: Reported types of crime include: Petty theft (money, passports, small valuables) from hotel rooms, local apartments, homes, offices, trains, and public transport. Various financial scams, including: inflated bar tabs dating scams in which someone you meet over the internet asks for money to help family, buy plane tickets, pay medical bills, or gain an immigration benefit. PIN theft from ATMs by \u201cskimming\u201d devices that record the card information, hidden cameras, and \u201cshoulder surfing\u201d sale of credit card information by vendors to third parties phishing schemes and bank account hacking internet auction fraud in which buyers fail to pay for purchases or send counterfeit checks as payment International letters and package mail are sometimes opened or pilfered. Sexual harassment of female visitors (isolated reports of unwanted verbal attention or touching in parks, on major streets, and in bars/night clubs in Chisinau both during the day and night). International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault, should report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(373) (22) 40-83-00. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. U.S. citizens should be aware that there have been reports of widespread corruption in all areas of the judicial system, including case dismissals without cause. In most cases, an investigation will not proceed if the complainant leaves the country prior to full conclusion of proceedings.

    "country_name": "Mongolia",
    "Safety and Security": "Travelers are urged to review the Mongolia Travel Advisory, which provides information about safety and security concerns affecting the country. The phone number to report crimes to the local police in Mongolia is 102. The number to call an ambulance or fire truck in an emergency is 103. Please note that local authorities, including the operators responding to these emergency numbers, do not commonly speak English. Crime: Mongolia is a relatively safe country for foreigners. However, both street crime and violent crime are on the rise, especially in the larger towns and cities. Crime typically peaks during the Naadam summer festival in July and during the Tsagaan Sar (Lunar New Year) festival in January or February. Most street crime occurs late at night, often outside bars and nightclubs. Theft: Pickpocketing and bag-snatching can occur at any time, especially in crowded places like markets, train stations, and popular tourist attractions. You should take precautions to protect your personal effects when in public. The Embassy has also received reports of visitors\u2019 accommodations being burgled while occupied. These burglaries most often occurred when travelers were staying in yurt (known in Mongolia as ger) camps where locking the door to the accommodation may be impossible. Robbery: The most common form of robbery experienced by visitors to Mongolia is mugging. You are most likely to be mugged if you are alone in unfamiliar urban neighborhoods after dark, or in unregistered private vehicles operating as taxis. Stick to well-lit and well-established tourist areas and use registered taxis whenever possible. Sexual assault: Though infrequent, the Embassy does receive reports of sexual assaults perpetrated against travelers. These reports indicate that perpetrators are most often familiar with the victim in some way such as tour guides or employees of locations frequented by tourists, like ger camps and monasteries. If you are a victim of sexual assault contact the Mongolian police immediately and seek assistance from the Embassy by calling +976 7007-6001. Female travelers are encouraged to avoid traveling alone in Mongolia and all travelers should research and hire only reputable tour agencies with established safety and security records, especially when visiting remote areas far from the capital. The police will instruct victims of sexual assault to obtain an examination at the criminal forensic institute, which is in Ulaanbaatar city or in provincial centers. A medical check from any other clinic/hospital will not be admitted into evidence at any judicial proceeding. The Embassy can assist in helping you locate these centers. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Street harassment: Street harassment is especially prevalent at night and in areas outside the capital. The most common targets of street harassment are unaccompanied women and foreign men accompanying Mongolian or other Asian women. Street harassment may range from verbal abuse to physical assault. Certain nationalist groups also perpetrate premeditated attacks against foreigners. Most street harassment occurs in or near bars and nightclubs, and alcohol is often involved. All travelers should avoid walking alone after dark, avoid using unregistered taxi cabs, and moderate their use of alcohol in order to avoid becoming an easy target for harassment in public. Drug offenses: Mongolian police are particularly keen on combatting the use of drugs, a problem they generally see as imported by foreigners. Penalties for drug possession and or trafficking in Mongolia range from one to twelve years imprisonment. Smuggling of contraband goods, antiquities, and wildlife: Smuggling of these items is prevalent across both the Russian and Chinese borders. Travelers have been known to be duped into transporting contraband goods or controlled antiquities from Mongolia. Be wary of other passengers requesting help with their luggage, as it could contain illicit articles. Penalties for smuggling in Mongolia vary based on the items smuggled and range from one month of electronic monitoring to eight years imprisonment and fines from 450,000 MNT to 40,000,000 MNT equivalent to 160 USD to 14,000 USD as of September 2020. Demonstrations: Demonstrations are common in many parts of Mongolia but are most prominent in the capital Ulaanbaatar. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and escalate into violence. Protesters may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstration areas and exercise caution if near any protests. Some demonstrations by Mongolian ultra-nationalists take a xenophobic turn and may place foreigners at heightened risk should they encounter these events. U.S. citizens should avoid participating in demonstrations and other activities that might be deemed political by Mongolian authorities. Alcohol: If you choose to drink alcohol, it is important to do so in moderation and to stop and seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. Alcohol is an important aspect of Mongolian social culture and strangers may offer to drink with travelers as a welcoming gesture. While most of these offers are innocuous and truly a friendly gesture, travelers should be wary of accepting beverages offered on the street by strangers who approach them late at night as these are often the precursor to a robbery. The prevalent use of alcohol is also connected to a high frequency of physical altercations sometimes resulting in injury. U.S. citizen travelers are known to have become wittingly or unwittingly involved in such altercations and injured. Driving under the influence: Mongolian police take driving under the influence very seriously and enforcement is vigorous in urban areas. Penalties for driving under the influence in Mongolia include a one-year suspension of driving privileges and a 400,000 MNT fine, roughly 140 USD as of September 2020. Travelers should exercise the same precautions as they would in the United States, use of a designated driver or a taxi, to avoid operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.  Victims of Crime: Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. If you are the victim of a crime you should contact the local authorities to file a Mongolian police report. You should also inform the U.S. Embassy. A crime may only be reported in person at the local police district having jurisdiction over the location where the crime occurred. Before reporting a crime, you may wish to consult an attorney. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of English-speaking lawyers that you may access online. You must have your passport or residency permit with you.  Once you report a crime to the police Mongolian law requires that you remain in the country for the duration of both the investigation and any subsequent trial. In some instances, the law provides for a victim to appoint a legal representative to take their place.   The police will instruct victims of assault or sexual assault to undergo an examination by the criminal forensic institute which is located in Ulaanbaatar or in provincial centers. No other medical examination will be accepted as evidence by Mongolian authorities. The Embassy can assist in helping you locate these centers. It is important to note that, if a victim does not file a complaint, police may refuse to investigate the crime--even if they have probable cause to suspect that a crime took place.  Please see our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.  If you are the victim of a crime the U.S. Embassy can: help you find appropriate medical care and provide a list of doctors and hospitals assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. as well as local resources provide an emergency loan for repatriation, which includes accommodation and flights back to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution replace a stolen, lost, or damaged passport Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Mongolia\u2019s vast area and limited road and communications infrastructure make emergency response challenging for local and national authorities. Mongolia\u2019s severe weather\u2014desert conditions in the summer in many tourist areas and dangerously cold in the winter (-40\u00b0 F) across the country\u2014exacerbates the potential for urgent situations, especially in the event of injury or becoming lost or disoriented outside of city centers. The Embassy recommends travelers not drive outside of Ulaanbaatar or other city centers after sunset.  In winter visitors should always keep high-quality cold-weather clothing in vehicles, even for short trips, to protect oneself in the event of delay or becoming stranded.  Routine safety inspections for emergency and medical equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and tour guides and tourist attraction staff may not be adequately trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, basic medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities, with significant limitations on the availability of medication and quality of health care.  First responders are generally unable to quickly access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance."

    "country_name": "Montenegro",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, rudimentary Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Montenegrin nightclubs are popular with foreign tourists. Patrons should be aware that these establishments can be crowded and may not comply with Western standards for occupancy control or fire safety. Crime: Police have limited English ability. Violent crime is rare. Robberies at ATMs increases during the May to September tourist season. Visitors should protect their PINs when using ATMs and monitor their card activity. Demonstrations occur frequently and some of them can be anti-American. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable and have the potential to escalate. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Security alerts pertaining to demonstrations can be found on the Embassy\u2019s website. Montenegrins are generally open and hospitable to visitors; however, visitors might encounter anti-foreign sentiment. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: Visitors needing emergency assistance may dial 112 to report a crime or request assistance. 112 is the common emergency telephone number for Europe and may be dialed from mobile telephones even with a foreign SIM card. Victims of crime may also contact the U.S. Embassy at +382 20 410 500. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. U.S. insurance providers may require a local police report to claim losses from theft or property damage. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

    "country_name": "Morocco",
    "Safety and Security": "All countries in the region remain vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations or individuals inspired by extremist ideology with little or no warning. The potential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens exists in Morocco. Long an important counterterrorism partner with the United States, Morocco\u2019s capable security services have taken robust actions to guard against terrorist attacks. Moroccan authorities continue to disrupt groups seeking to attack U.S. or Western-affiliated and Moroccan government targets, arresting numerous individuals associated with international terrorist groups. Nevertheless, credible information indicates terrorist groups continue to plot potential attacks in the region, including Morocco. Lone wolf attacks are difficult to detect and disrupt and can occur without warning. In December 2018, two Scandinavian tourists were murdered by three Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) supporters in the Imlil Mountains near Marrakesh. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regards to their personal security. Establishments that are identifiable with the United States are potential targets for attacks. These may include facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate, including clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels, movie theaters, U.S. brand establishments, and other public areas.  U.S. citizen campers should camp in guarded campgrounds rather than isolated campsites. Demonstrations: Demonstrations occur frequently in Morocco, are typically focused on political or social issues, and are only rarely confrontational or violent. During periods of heightened regional tension, large demonstrations may take place in major cities. By law, all demonstrations require a government permit, but spontaneous unauthorized demonstrations, which have greater potential for violence, can occur. In addition, different unions or groups may organize strikes to protest an emerging issue or government policy. Travelers should be aware of current events in Morocco and stay informed of regional issues that could resonate in Morocco and create an anti-American response. Avoid demonstrations if at all possible. If caught in a demonstration, remain calm and move away immediately when provided the opportunity. Exercise increased vigilance in areas that attract large crowds, such as sporting events. Western Sahara: From 1975 to 1991, Western Sahara was the site of armed conflict between Moroccan government forces and the POLISARIO Front, which continues to seek independence for the territory. Tensions along the border in Western Sahara heightened in November 2020 when Moroccan forces conducted an operation on the border to clear a blockade by the POLISARIO Front; both sides have since engaged in a low intensity conflict along the border. There are thousands of unexploded mines in the Western Sahara and in areas of Mauritania adjacent to the Western Saharan border. Exploding mines are occasionally reported and have caused death and injury. There have been instances in which U.S. citizens suspected of being participants in political protests or of supporting NGOs that are critical of Moroccan policies have been expelled from, or not been allowed to enter, Western Sahara. Crime: Crime in Morocco is a serious concern, particularly in major cities and tourist areas. Use common sense and the same personal security measures you would normally use in a large U.S. city or tourist destination.  Do not leave bags unattended. Keep them in sight and avoid placing passports, cash, cell phones, or other valuables in the outer pockets of backpacks or purses, or on tables in public places. Do not leave bags slung over the backs of chairs, on hotel or store counters, on top of your suitcase or larger travel bag, or out of your physical control in hotel lobbies, train stations, restaurants, and other public locations. Aggressive panhandling, pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, theft from unoccupied vehicles, and harassment of women are the most frequently reported issues. Criminals use weapons, primarily knives, during some street robberies and burglaries. These crimes have occurred at any time of day or night, not only in isolated places or areas less frequented by visitors, but in crowded areas as well. Residential break-ins also occur and have on occasion turned violent, but most criminals look for opportunities based on stealth rather than confrontation. Travelers should avoid soccer stadiums and their environs on days of scheduled matches as large groups of team supporters have been known to become unruly and harass and assault bystanders.  Joggers should be mindful of traffic and remain in more heavily populated areas. It is always best to have a jogging companion, dress modestly, and avoid isolated areas or jogging at night. At night and when moving about unfamiliar areas, avoid traveling alone and utilize \u201cpetit\u201d taxis which vary by color in the major cities (Casablanca-Red, Rabat-Blue, Marrakech-Tan, etc.). Taxis* in Morocco are generally crime-free during day time, although city buses are not considered safe. Trains are generally safe, but theft, regardless of the time of day, sometimes occurs. Avoid carrying large sums of cash and be particularly alert when using ATM machines. In the event you are victimized by crime or an attempted crime, please report the incident to the local police and the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca as soon as possible. * NOTE: Some popular web-based ride-sharing services have operated in Morocco; however, the French-based company Heetch is currently the only service legally authorized to operate by the Moroccan Government. Media report that drivers of web-based ride-sharing services have been harassed and assaulted by regular taxi drivers in the recent past. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crimes should contact the local police at 19 from a land line or 190 from a mobile phone, and the U.S. Consulate in Casablanca at (212) 522 64 20 99. Remember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: help you find appropriate medical care; assist you in reporting a crime to the police; with written consent, contact your relatives or friends; explain the local criminal justice process in general terms; provide a list of local attorneys; provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the United States; provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution; help you find accommodation and arrange flights home; replace a stolen or lost passport. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated in major tourist areas.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. However, outside of these areas, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage."

    "Safety and Security": "Please read the full Travel Advisory for Mozambique. Road travel outside the city after dark is dangerous. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling outside the major cities after dark by car, and are encouraged not to travel outside the city alone. You should be vigilant when you travel in Mozambique and if you travel to/from South Africa, as both countries have high crime rates. Crime: Street crimes, including mugging, purse-snatching, and pick-pocketing are common in Maputo and in secondary cities. Carjackings are rare, but still occur. Pedestrians have been mugged at all hours of the day. Avoid isolated areas and walking at night, even in well-known tourist areas. Avoid walking along the Marginal south of the Southern Sun Hotel and Avenida Friedrich Engels and Rua Caracol. Avoid walking along roads bordered by wooded areas, as criminals may hide there. Johannesburg International Airport: Secure your bags. Use an airport plastic wrapping service. Avoid placing currency and high value items in checked luggage when transiting. Landmines: Mozambique was declared free of all known landmines in 2015; however, there could remain unknown mines in very rural areas.

Fraud: The U.S. Embassy in Maputo has received reports of scams which originate online, and involve promises of large inheritances that require international travel. Victims of this type of scam are asked to deliver suitcases from one location to another, and become unwitting narcotics traffickers. Be skeptical about financial promises made by an online contact, and never carry anything that you did not pack yourself. See the Department of State page for more information on scams.  Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  There is some tourism infrastructure, often operated by expatriates, but the host government has limited capacity to regulate.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified, either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the relevant field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.

    "country_name": "Namibia",
    "Safety and Security": "Road Travel:  Namibia has thousands of miles of unpaved roads. Road accidents, particularly on gravel roads, pose the most serious threat to visitors. Many gravel roads are well-maintained and can provide unaccustomed drivers a false sense of security, with road conditions shifting dramatically in certain areas. See recommendations below on road safety in Namibia.  Crime:  Non-violent crimes of opportunity are the most common incidents reported by foreigners and include pick pocketing, purse snatching, ATM card skimming, and vehicle thefts and break-ins. Criminals sometimes brandish knives and guns. Violent crimes, including murder and rape, and property crimes increased in Windhoek over the last year. Robberies occur at roadside rest stops.  Dress conservatively.  Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property.  Make sure your hotel room or residence is well secured, including windows.  Keep your credit card in your sight at all times while it is being processed. Consider using prepaid credit cards with limited funds when traveling.  Take rest breaks in towns and/or at gasoline stations.  Transport crimes: Violent assaults on taxi passengers are known to occur; petty theft is prevalent and occurs on trains, buses, and in taxis.  Be aware of criminals using remote key fobs to unlock vehicle doors in parking lots.  Drive with doors locked and windows closed.  Keep valuables out of sight and do not use cell phones or laptops while stopped in traffic; bandits may use smash and grab tactics to steal valuables.  Hire taxis through a hotel or retain the services of a reputable private transport company.  Checkpoints: The police maintain checkpoints approximately 9 miles (15 km) outside of main cities and all major highways. During the holiday season, additional checkpoints may be established along the Windhoek-Swakopmund highway (B1).  Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate.  Be prepared to produce vehicle registration documents, personal identification (passport, Namibian identification cards), car rental contracts, and/or drivers\u2019 licenses.

    "country_name": "Nepal",
    "Safety and Security": "All U.S. Citizen travelers are encouraged to enroll into Smart Traveler Enrollment Program while traveling abroad. This is a free service that allows U.S. citizens traveling or living abroad to receive the latest security updates from the U.S. Embassy. Enrolling in STEP will help the U.S. embassy contact them and provide assistance during an emergency overseas. U.S. government employees on official travel to Nepal must seek approval before traveling outside of Kathmandu Valley. Political-Related Violence: The potential for isolated political-related violence remains a real risk in Nepal. There are occasionally small-scale improvised explosive device (IED) incidents in various parts of Nepal, particularly during periods of heightened political tension. Reported incidents have not been directed toward Westerners or Western interests but have caused injury and damage to nearby individuals and property. The Embassy is also aware of extortion attempts and threats of violence by a local group against private businesses and aid organizations, including local and international schools within the Kathmandu Valley. Historically, violent political activity has been more prevalent in the Terai \u2013 the southern plains region of Nepal bordering India \u2013 than elsewhere in Nepal. Demonstrations have on occasion turned violent, although these activities generally have not been directed at U.S. citizens. Bandhs: Bandhs (general strikes) were formerly a common form of political agitation in Nepal but have occurred only infrequently in recent years. Bandhs are unpredictable, may include violent incidents, and can occur with little notice. They can cause schools and businesses to close and can stop traffic. Individuals not complying with bandhs may be harassed, and in extreme cases assaulted, by supporters. If you plan air travel to or from Nepal during a scheduled bandh, please note that transportation may be affected. Usually, bandh organizers allow specially marked buses operated by the Nepal Tourism Board to travel between the airport and major tourist hotels. Do not attend or approach political demonstrations or checkpoints established during bandhs. Avoid all unnecessary travel where bandhs are occurring. Actions to Take: Avoid all large gatherings, protests, and demonstrations. Report any difficulties or security concerns to police. Monitor local media for updates. Do not engage in argumentative or combative behavior if challenged or told that you cannot go to access a certain area. Keep a low profile. Be aware of your surroundings. Crime: Although relatively low, crime in Kathmandu and throughout the country has risen in some categories, including: Financial Crimes and Theft: Pickpocketing and bag-snatching may occur at major tourist sites, including the Thamel area of Kathmandu. Store valuables, including passports and cash, in the hotel safety deposit box; do not carry them. The Nepal Tourist Police recommend that you carry a photocopy of your passport when going out. Exchange money only at banks, hotels and government authorized money exchanger. Criminals use sophisticated scams, such as ATM skimming, particularly in Kathmandu. Avoid walking alone after dark, carrying large sums of cash, and wearing expensive jewelry. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Violent Crimes: Travel in groups, especially at night. While not common, sexual assaults against foreigners have been reported, including in popular tourist areas of Kathmandu and Pokhara, and in remote mountainous areas. Be aware of your surroundings. Foreigners have occasionally had sedative drugs added to their food or drink by individuals who seek to rob or otherwise take advantage of them. Solo travelers should take extra precautions to ensure their personal safety. We strongly recommend no solo trekking. Local guide service is available in trekking regions. Nepali police forces may have limited resources to deter and investigate crimes. Many criminal cases reported to the police remain unresolved. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for information on available resources and assistance. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing \u201c100\" as soon as incident occurs. This number is equivalent to \u201c911\u201d in the United States, and it is staffed 24/7 by the local police. When calling the emergency number, speak slowly and clearly so that your message gets across to the official without misunderstanding. Tourist Police, who can be reached by dialing \u201c1144, +977-01-4247041 or +977-9851289444\u201d have good English language capabilities and also stand ready to assist in popular tourism areas. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. For additional information, visit the State Department\u2019s webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. U.S. citizen victims of crime in Nepal may always contact the U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu for assistance. Sexual assault victims might be more comfortable contacting the Embassy before reporting the crime to local authorities. In the event of a crime, the Embassy can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide a list of local attorneys Provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the United States Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance and be aware of potential insurance fraud. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Local authorities are generally the best first responder in emergency situations. Many local resources are available by phone, although it may become necessary to flag down an officer or visit a local police or government office. In the event of an emergency, dial 100 to contact the police in Nepal. This number is equivalent to \u201c911\u201d in the United States, and it is staffed 24/7 by the local police. Their toll free number is 16600141916. Tourist Police have good English language skills and are often a better point of contact for foreigners than the regular police. They generally stand ready to assist in popular tourism areas. Dial 1144 for the tourist police hotline. They can be reached at +977-01-4247041 or +977-9851289444. The Tourist Police Office is located at Bhrikuti Mandap, Kathmandu, Tourist Service Center Building. Nepal Police telephone directory is available for quick reference. Dial 101 for fire. Dial 102 for ambulance service. Dial 103 for traffic control. Dial 197 for telephone inquiry. U.S. citizens requiring emergency assistance may contact the U.S. Embassy at any time. For an emergency involving death, arrest, serious illness or injury, or anything that threatens the life or safety of a U.S. citizen in Nepal during the weekends and holidays, call +977-01-423-7266. During normal business hours, call the operator at 01-423-4000 and tell that you have a U.S. citizen emergency and ask to be transferred to the American Citizen Services Unit. After normal business hours, describe your U.S. citizen emergency to the operator and ask to be connected with the Duty Officer, who is on-call at all times for emergency situations involving the life and safety of U.S. citizens, but cannot assist in any way with visa inquiries or routine services. If the primary number does not work, you can also call the analog back-up number, +977-01-423-4500. The State Department\u2019s Office of Overseas Citizens Services also stands ready to assist. From the United States and Canada, dial +1-888-407-4747 and from overseas dial +1-202-501-4444.

    "country_name": "Niger",
    "Safety and Security": "Travelers to Niger are urged to exercise extreme caution due to the risk of terror attacks and kidnapping threats against Westerners. U.S. citizens should reduce exposure to locations frequented by Westerners such as restaurants and nightclubs. Visitors are urged to stay in hotels with armed Nigerien security presence. Due to security threats, the U.S. Embassy restricts the travel of U.S. government employees and official visitors outside of Niamey. These restrictions may limit the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist visitors in these areas. The border region with Mali continues to be of specific concern. There are frequent and ongoing reports of terrorists and affiliates crossing into and through Niger from Mali. A U.S. citizen was kidnapped from the area in October 2016. Niger\u2019s southeastern border with Nigeria and east of Maradi are poorly controlled. Boko Haram and several factions affiliated with ISIS have conducted cross-border attacks into Niger. The Government of Niger has increased its security forces in the border areas, but the situation remains unstable and travel is not advised. For travel in any remote area of the country, the Department of State urges travelers to use guides and to travel with a minimum of two vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite phones. Street demonstrations occur frequently in Niger. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational without warning. Avoid demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Refer to the U.S. Embassy Niger website for the most updated safety and security information. Crime:  Thefts and petty crimes are common day or night. Tourists should not walk alone in Niger, but areas in Niamey near the Gaweye Hotel, the National Museum, the Petit March\u00e9, and on or near the Kennedy Bridge are of particular concern. In general, walking at night is not recommended. Counterfeit and pirated goods are available, but transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. Carrying them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, contact the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. There is no local equivalent to a \u201c911\u201d emergency line in Niger. U.S. citizens can try calling local police by dialing \u201c17\u201d on Nigerien phones or +227-20-72-25-53, but calls to these numbers often go unanswered, especially outside of normal working hours. The Embassy highly recommends hiring guards for your residence if you are planning to live in Niger. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

There are continuing concerns in the region of returning Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs) and the potential for radicalization to violence.  North Macedonia authorities assess that ISIS members and sympathizers maintain a presence in North Macedonia. In the past year, during a six month period, North Macedonia was subject to false bomb threats to local schools, transportation hubs, commercial centers, and hotels. Though all threats were found to be false, local authorities responded to every threat and continue to investigate the threats\u2019 origin. For more information, see our Terrorism page.  Crime: Violent crime against U.S. citizens is rare. Theft and other petty street crimes do occur, particularly in areas where tourists and foreigners congregate. Do not leave anything of value in plain view in unattended vehicles. Securely lock the windows and doors of your residence when not at home. Organized crime is present in North Macedonia, and violent confrontations between rival organizations occasionally occur. ATM use is generally safe; however, take standard safety precautions and be aware of your surroundings. Pickpockets are a problem in crowded areas of Skopje. You should: Be aware of your belongings and surroundings at all times. Know that pickpockets use various diversionary tactics to distract victims, including groups of children swarming the victim. If pickpocketed, report the crime to the police. Cancel your credit cards as quickly as possible. North Macedonia and the surrounding Balkan region continue to face challenges from corruption and from organized crime, particularly in connection with drug trafficking, money laundering, trafficking of migrants, extortion, and property crimes, as well as fraudulent documents. For additional information, please refer to the Global Organized Crime Index which is a tool designed to measure levels of organized crime in a given country and assess its resilience to organized criminal activity. Demonstrations occur sporadically and often result in traffic disruptions, particularly near the center of Skopje. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Crime:\u202f Norway has a low level of crime and violent crime is uncommon.   The most likely forms of crime, especially in the Oslo metropolitan area, include residential and office burglaries and petty thefts. Pickpocketing and petty theft occur more frequently in major tourist areas, hotel lobbies, train and transit stations, and surrounding areas. The Oslo Central train station is an especially popular area for pickpockets and bag snatchers. Although rare, violent and weapons-related crimes do occur in areas known to have drug trafficking and gang problems, such as certain parts of eastern Oslo. As in any other urban area, you should remain aware of your surroundings at all times.

    "country_name": "Pakistan",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Extremist groups within Pakistan continue to seek opportunities to attack locations where U.S. citizens and Westerners are known to congregate or visit, including government facilities and public locations, such as schools and universities, shopping malls, markets, hotels, clubs and restaurants, , transportation hubs/stations, minority neighborhoods, and outdoor recreation areas. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates  prohibit personnel from visiting houses of worship. Terrorists also target Pakistani officials, government facilities, security forces, religious minorities and facilities including Sufi shrines, and regularly resort to kidnapping for ransom. Attacks have included armed assaults on heavily guarded sites, including Pakistani military and police installations, and airports. Primary terrorist tactics include suicide operations, gunfire, and bombings (including vehicle-borne explosives and improvised explosive devices), while other actions include but are not limited to assassinations, carjackings, and assaults. The Government of Pakistan maintains heightened security measures, particularly in major cities, and these measures can vary from day to day. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates regularly assess security situations and restrict the movements of official personnel.   Demonstrations, political rallies, or large religious gatherings intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. We advise U.S. citizens to avoid areas where large crowds of any kind gather. U.S Embassy and Consulate personnel are routinely instructed to avoid areas of any demonstration. During demonstrations or periods of civil unrest, the Pakistani government has in the past disabled cellular telephone and internet service, making it difficult for individuals to contact each other or the U.S. Embassy or Consulates. Celebratory gunfire may occur at any time but is most likely to occur during wedding celebrations, which are frequent from October to May, and on holidays such as New Year\u2019s Eve. Although the likelihood of being struck is remote, falling rounds can cause injury or death. We recommend you limit the frequency of travel and minimize the duration of trips to public markets, restaurants, and other public locations. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates prohibit personnel from using public transportation or taxi services. With few exceptions, official visitors are not authorized to stay overnight in local hotels anywhere in the country; we strongly urge you to avoid hotels that do not apply stringent security measures. Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to official personnel.  Threats to civil aviation in Pakistan are not limited to attacks in which militants target airports. The U.S. government is aware of narcotics smuggled onto flights from Pakistan, which may indicate broader security vulnerabilities at Pakistani airports. We recommend you follow media coverage of local events and maintain good situational awareness and operational security wherever you travel in Pakistan. If you feel that your life is in danger in Pakistan, we advise you to report the threat to local police authorities and consider immediately changing locations or departing Pakistan. For more information, see our Terrorism page.   Crime: All travelers are advised to dress conservatively, with arms and legs covered, and to avoid walking alone. We recommend against travel on the streets late at night. Urban crime can be organized or opportunistic and conducted by individuals or groups. It can include fraud, theft, robbery, carjacking, rape, assault, and burglary. Incidents of crime and levels of violence are higher in low-income residential and congested commercial areas but are seen in wealthier areas as well. Pickpocketing, theft, and larceny are common on buses and trains at all hours of the day. Take precautions to avoid crime, including: locking home and vehicle doors hiring a 24-hour guard varying routes and schedules keeping bags or valuables under your legs away from passing vehicle traffic and ensuring that bag straps are not visible traveling in groups being accompanied by someone with the ability to speak the local language if you travel outside urban areas carrying your mobile phone If you are assaulted, flee to a safe area and report the situation to local authorities by going directly to a police station or dialing 15. Demonstrations occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.   Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.   Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.   During demonstrations or periods of civil unrest/heightened security concern, the Pakistani government has in the past disabled cellular telephone and internet service, making it difficult for individuals to contact each other or the U.S. Embassy or Consulates. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.  Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police at 15 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(92)(51) 201-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Police responsiveness varies widely, and crimes often go unsolved or unprosecuted. Dual U.S-Pakistani nationals may not be recognized as U.S. citizens by local authorities.

Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.

    "country_name": "Panama",
    "Safety and Security": "The Mosquito Gulf and the Darien Region are particularly dangerous due to their remoteness and the presence of criminal organizations. In the Darien region, most travel is by river or by footpath due to the scarcity of roads. There are reports of narco-traffickers, and other smugglers and criminals operating in the Panama-Colombia border area. Access to the \u201cMosquito Gulf\u201d region is almost exclusively by boat and/or aircraft. Sections of this coastline are reportedly used for narco-trafficking and other illicit activities. Demonstrations:  There are often demonstrations to protest internal Panamanian issues or, more rarely, manifestations of anti-American sentiment. Some demonstrations may result in blocked roadways or major highways including in locations popular with U.S. citizens. Panamanian National Police will generally not use force against peaceful demonstrations or roadblocks. While most demonstrations are non-violent, the Panamanian National Police have used tear gas and/or riot control munitions in response to demonstrations, particularly when roadways are blocked or aggression is used against the police. Beach and Maritime Safety:  Many of Panama\u2019s beaches on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts are subject to large waves and dangerous currents. Conditions can change rapidly and drowning deaths occur. Few beaches feature lifeguards. Boaters should be wary of vessels that may be transporting narcotics, other illicit materials, or might be involved in human smuggling operations. Packages containing narcotics have been found floating in the ocean or lying on remote beaches. Do not pick up or move these packages. Immediately report their location to the Panamanian authorities. Local maritime search and rescue capabilities are limited. If you are experiencing an emergency at sea or know of someone who is experiencing an emergency off the coast of Panama, please contact the Panamanian authorities. Crime:  Panama City, Colon, and Chiriqui province have the highest crime rates. Crimes include shootings, home invasions, rapes, armed robberies, muggings, and thefts. You should take the same precautions you would take in other big cities. Remove valuables from your car. Keep windows up and doors locked while driving. Use only licensed and registered taxis. Avoid taxis with passengers and instruct the driver not to pick up additional fares while en-route to your destination. Regular taxis are yellow in color. Many hotels also have \u201ctourist taxis\u201d that are not yellow but only pick up passengers in front of well-known hotels. Taxis in Panama do not use meters so agree on a fare before getting into the taxi. Victims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police by dialing 104 (National Police) or 511-9260 (Tourist Police in Panama City) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +507-317-5000.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes that occur in Panama. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

    "country_name": "Papua New Guinea",
    "Safety and Security": "Summary: Crime is a significant concern. U.S. citizens have been victims of violent crime, including sexual assault, carjacking, home invasions, kidnappings, and armed robberies. Tensions between communal or clan groups may result in violent conflict at any time, including in Port Moresby and other urban areas. Exercise a high degree of caution in remote areas, as law enforcement presence is extremely limited and tourist and transportation facilities are inadequate. Unexploded ordinance and mines may be found in Bougainville, East New Britain, and throughout the Papua New Guinea islands. Exercise caution when walking or hiking off marked roads and trails. There has been a recent uptick in small-scale piracy, particularly in waters surrounding Madang and Milne Bay. Crime: Papua New Guinea has a high crime rate. Crime rates are highest in and around major cities such as Port Moresby, Lae, Madang, Mount Hagen, and Goroka, but crimes can occur anywhere. You are at a greater risk of violent crime such as sexual assault if you travel alone, especially if you plan to hike in isolated rural areas. Pickpockets and bag-snatchers frequent crowded public areas, including parks, golf courses, beaches, and cemeteries. Bag-snatchers may try to open doors of automobiles that are stopped or moving slowly in traffic. Please see our page on Personal Safety. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes and law enforcement-related emergencies to local police by calling 112. In the event you are unable to get through to the police, operators with St. John Ambulance Service may be able to assist you by passing your request to the police control center. You may also contact the U.S. Embassy at +675 308 2100. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  Organized Tours and Adventure Travel Organized tours booked through travel agencies remain the safest means to visit Papua New Guinea, although on rare occasions, even persons participating in organized tours have been subject to violent crime and injury. If you choose to travel to Papua New Guinea with a group tour, here are some things to be aware of: Excursions to local shops, restaurants, and tourist sights should be done in groups. Security protocols, standards of professionalism, and pricing can vary widely among tour operators and local guides. Unscrupulous tour guides or criminal elements may attempt to extort money from tour groups and individual travelers through the use of informal roadblocks, unwarranted delays, or by imposing additional undisclosed fees. Before making tour arrangements, research tour operators and guides, and compare itineraries through multiple sources, including the Papua New Guinea Tourism Promotion Authority. Diving and Snorkeling: Scuba divers and or snorkelers are advised to check the references, licenses, and equipment of tour operators before agreeing to a tour. Confirm the dive operator is certified through one of the international diving associations, and that their certification is current. Confirm with the diving association directly that the operator is certified. Local dive masters may not consider your skill level when they organize a trip. Rent equipment only from trustworthy operators and be sure to receive training before using the equipment. Some rental diving equipment may not be properly maintained or inspected. Make sure that your travel medical insurance covers your sport. The Divers Alert Network (DAN) website has information on diver\u2019s insurance. Deaths and serious accidents have occurred in the past because basic safety precautions were not taken during diving and snorkeling trips. Remember that safety measures and emergency responses may not meet U.S. standards. Papua New Guinea has one hyperbaric recompression chamber to provide medical assistance for dive-related injuries, located in Port Moresby at the Tropicair Hangar at Jacksons International Airport. However, it may not always be operational. Diving injuries may therefore require medical evacuation to Australia. Many popular dive sites are located near outlying islands, and it may take several hours to reach facilities in the event of an accident. Other Water Sports: Exercise caution and common sense when engaging in all adventure sports, including but not limited to whitewater rafting, sea kayaking, and windsailing. Make sure your travel medical insurance covers your sport. Never participate in adventure sports alone. Before kayaking, rafting, or windsailing, check water conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Water conditions may become extremely dangerous during heavy rainfall, and flash floods are common. Hiking: Exercise caution if you plan to hike the Kokoda Track, the Black Cat Track, Mt. Wilhelm, Mt. Giluwe, or other established or informal hiking trails in Papua New Guinea. Hikers have been attacked and killed, even along the most well-known routes. Local landowners occasionally threaten to close parts of the tracks due to local land and compensation disputes. Carry a first aid kit and observe all local and trail-specific regulations. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance."

    "country_name": "Paraguay",
    "Safety and Security": "Security Messages: Messages regarding demonstrations, strikes, and weather-related events are posted on the Embassy\u2019s website. Terrorism: The U.S. Embassy is not aware of any specific threat to U.S. citizens in Paraguay. Nevertheless, you should remain vigilant at all times while travelling. Crime: Transnational criminal organizations facilitate the illicit trafficking of arms, narcotics, and other goods in Paraguay, particularly along Paraguay\u2019s eastern border with Brazil, most prominently from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, including the Tri-Border Area of Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Coupled with the lack of sufficient police enforcement, the involvement of these organizations heightens violent crime in these areas. The U.S. Embassy in Asuncion requires U.S. government personnel and their family members to provide advance notice and a travel itinerary when traveling outside of the capital, particularly when traveling to Ciudad del Este, or to the departments of Alto Parana, San Pedro, Concepcion, Amambay, and Canindeyu. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Paraguay should also avoid large gatherings or events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches. Street crime is prevalent in the cities and the number of pickpockets and armed assaults is increasing. Robbers are more regularly using motorcycles to approach victims with a weapon and demand a wallet or purse, before quickly fleeing. Thieves have been known to pose as service people (e.g., mailmen, reporters, water meter readers, electrical repairmen, delivery persons, maintenance personnel) to gain access to homes. They sometimes wear uniforms and travel in vans and automobiles with markings that make the vehicle appear official. Do not let such people inside your home unless you have contacted the service provider directly to verify the appointment. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy.  Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+595) 021-213-715 and press 2210 (Dial (+595) (21) 229 581 after hours).

    "country_name": "Peru",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)  Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists  Places of worship  Schools  Parks  Shopping malls and markets  Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)   U.S. Embassy Lima enforces a Restricted Travel Policy for Embassy personnel, which is based on its assessment of conditions and developments throughout the country. See the Overseas Security and Advisory Council\u2019s Country Security Report for Peru. See the latest Travel Advisory for Peru. The VRAEM (Valley of the Apur\u00edmac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers) is particularly remote and a known safe haven for narcotraffickers and the last operational remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group. For more information, see our Terrorism page.   Crime: Crime is a widespread problem in Peru. Sexual assaults and rapes can occur, even in tourist areas. Travel in groups, do not leave food or drinks unattended, and use caution if a stranger offers you food or drink. Intoxicated travelers, including U.S. citizens, also have been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Pick-pocketing, robbery, and hotel room theft are the most common crimes. Armed robberies have occurred throughout the city, including popular tourist destinations. Armed assailants usually target victims for their smartphones, wallets, or purses. If confronted by someone with a weapon, it is best not to resist. Incapacitating drugs, such as rohypnol and scopolamine, have been used to facilitate robberies and sexual assaults. Seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. On routes to and from the airport in Lima, robberies have occurred where the assailant uses a tool to break a window while the vehicle is stopped in traffic.  Keep your belongings in the trunk or out of sight. Authorized taxi booths are present at the airport in Lima that will charge a flat rate according to the destination. Use hotel safes, if available. Avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or clothing, and carry only the cash or credit cards that you need. Stay alert in crowds and on public transportation. Be aware that thieves might create distractions to target you. Avoid isolated areas when on foot, especially after dark. Be alert for robberies in which criminals enter a taxi and force victims to withdraw money from ATMs. Use an app-based taxi service, order a taxi by phone, or use a service affiliated with a major hotel, as it is usually safer than hailing an unknown taxi on the street. Use ATMs in well-protected indoor areas such as banks or shopping malls. Avoid withdrawing large amounts of cash at one time. Do not let your credit card out of your sight in order to avoid credit card \u201cskimming.\u201d You should expect the vendor to use a credit card reader in your presence. The vendor will ask for your passport or ID number on the receipt. To avoid carjacking or theft from your car while you are stopped at intersections, drive with your doors locked and windows rolled up. Do not leave valuables in plain view. There is little government presence in many remote areas of the Andes and Amazon basin. Illicit activities, such as illegal mining, logging, and coca production, are common. Drug trafficking and other criminal activity, combined with poor infrastructure, limit the capability and effectiveness of Peruvian law enforcement in these areas. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens along the Colombian border and in the VRAEM, as U.S. government personnel are restricted from traveling in these regions. Demonstrations\u202foccur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less-sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) U.S. citizens should remain alert to the potential for explosions and bombings as part of pre-planned attacks, as well as the threat of kidnapping. Terrorist and armed groups continue plotting possible kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in the Philippines. Terrorist and armed groups may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. The Philippine government has declared a \u201cState of National Emergency on Account of Lawless Violence in Mindanao.\u201d On August 24, 2020, dual suicide bombings in Jolo, Sulu, Mindanao, killed 15 people and injured 77 others. For more information, please visit our website here. Crime: Confidence games (con games), pickpocketing, Internet scams, and credit/ATM card fraud are common. Be wary of unknown individuals who attempt to befriend you, especially just after you arrive in country. Do not accept food, drinks, or rides in private vehicles from strangers, even if they appear to be legitimate. Solo travelers have been drugged and robbed by strangers after accepting an invitation to visit a tourist destination. Kidnappings, physical assaults, murder-for-hire, and other violent crimes occur in the Philippines. Philippine government law enforcement agencies are engaged in a nationwide counter-narcotics campaign that has resulted in a sharp increase in violence between police and individuals suspected of involvement in the drug trade. As part of this campaign, law enforcement is engaged in aggressive search and buy-bust operations that could affect foreigners. Taxis or ride-sharing applications are the recommended form of public transportation. However, taxi drivers and/or individuals using stolen taxi cabs have committed robberies. Ask the hotel, restaurant, and/or business establishment to call a reliable taxi service for you. Do not enter a taxi if it has already accepted another passenger. Request that the taxi driver use the meter to record your fare. Wait for another cab if the driver is unwilling to comply with these requests. Make a mental note of the license plate number of your taxi, or text it to someone, should there be a problem. When driving in the city, make certain that vehicle doors are locked and windows are rolled up. Travelers have been stopped and robbed shortly after leaving Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport in a taxi or private vehicle.  One common form of credit/ATM card fraud involves an illicit electronic device attached to ATM card readers that retrieves and records information, including the PIN, from a card's magnetic strip. Refer to the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) website for more information. International Financial Scams:  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in the Philippines. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.

Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism:  Please check with the Philippine Department of Tourism before traveling. The safety standards you might expect of transport and tour operators, including adventure activities such as diving, are not always met. Sufficient safety equipment may not be provided, and recommended maintenance standards and safety precautions may not be observed. Always use available safety equipment, such as lifejackets or seatbelts, even if others do not. If appropriate safety equipment is not available, use another provider. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. If you are planning to dive, the Diver\u2019s Alert Network (DAN) provides information on diving accident management."

If someone directs you to pull over or signals that something is wrong with your car, continue driving until you reach a safe spot (such as a crowded gas station, supermarket, or a police station) to inspect your vehicle. Only change money at banks or legitimate exchange kiosks (kantor).  ATMs at commercial banks, large hotels, shopping malls, and airports are safest. While casinos and gaming establishments are government-regulated, some are affiliated with or have attracted the interest of organized crime. Avoid adult entertainment venues. Such establishments have been known to present foreign customers with inflated charges and threaten those who refuse to pay. There have been some incidents of suspected drink spiking associated with these venues. Travel in a group when going out at night to nightclubs, discos, bars, or high-tourism areas, such as the Market Square in Krakow and Old Town in Warsaw. Demonstrations occur frequently.

    "Safety and Security": "Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries, including Portugal, remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regard to their personal security. Crime: Crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, particularly at popular tourist sites, restaurants, and on public transportation, are common. Pickpockets take advantage of crowds getting on and off all forms of public transportation, such as the popular Tram 28, using the jostling of the crowd as a distraction. Avoid standing near the doors on public transportation, as thieves will often strike just as the train/bus doors open and then dash onto the platform and disappear into the crowd. Safeguard your passport and identity documents when traveling throughout Portugal. Foreigners who arrive in Portugal without a valid passport will not be permitted to enter and will be returned to their point of origin. Be aware of your surroundings and take personal security measures to stay safe. Thefts of backpacks, electronics and luggage occur regularly. Do not leave valuables in rental cars, especially those with stickers identifying the vehicle as a rental car. Tourists are frequent victims of petty crime/car break-ins. Avoid using automatic teller machines (ATMs) in isolated or poorly lit areas. Use the buddy system and indoor bank ATMs when possible. Leave extra cash, credit cards, and personal documents at home or in a hotel safe. Keep doors and windows of private rentals locked at all times, taking extra care if easily accessed from the street or other places. Illicit drug transactions increase at night, and travelers are often approached by drug dealers in the downtown area of Lisbon, especially near the bars and restaurants. Some travelers have reported incidents in which criminals used drugs to assault or rob them. Use caution when accepting open drinks at bars or clubs, and do not leave drinks unattended. Always use a taxi from the queue or kiosk. Do not go with someone who walks up to you and offers a ride. If you have called a ride sharing service such as Uber, confirm that the car information in the App matches the vehicle you are entering. Tourists should not leave personal items or valuables unattended while at the beach. Reports of thefts from rental homes and online rental apartments have increased.  Secure belongings and lock windows while away or sleeping. Demonstrations occur in Portugal. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

    "country_name": "Republic of the Congo",
    "Safety and Security": "Political violence and civil unrest may occur. In the past, political demonstrations have led to armed clashes, deaths, and injuries. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Official travel outside Brazzaville must be approved by the Embassy on a case-by-case basis. The Republic of Congo\u2019s borders remain porous, particularly with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic; cross-border crime and armed activity may occur. National Parks and Wildlife Areas: Heed all instructions given by guides or trackers. Armed poachers are present in some parks and forested border regions. Ensure you have the proper medical and medevac insurance for safari/adventure tours. Roadblocks: Armed soldiers or national police may conduct vehicle searches and check passengers for identity papers. These roadblocks often are poorly marked, and local authorities may target foreigners to solicit bribes. Crime: While not common, violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, and assault, remains a concern throughout the Republic of the Congo. Opportunistic crime, such as petty theft, pickpocketing, mugging, vehicle theft, and burglary, are frequently reported. Most crimes affecting expatriates in Brazzaville involve financially motivated opportunistic theft, robbery, and/or burglary, sometimes involving the use of bladed weapons. Risk of crime increases at night and in remote or isolated areas. Violent crime exists in outlying southern and northern neighborhoods of Brazzaville due to armed gang activity. Demonstrations occur, though they have been on a small-scale in recent years. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Gatherings of armed gangs may occur in Brazzaville\u2019s outlying neighborhoods; gang members have been known to perpetrate random acts of violence against passersby.

    "Safety and Security": "The U.S. Embassy advises all travelers to review the following information: Rwanda-Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) border, including parts of Volcanoes National Park: Tensions between Rwanda and DRC have been elevated since early 2022 with Rwanda and DRC accusing each other of supporting armed groups that pose security threats to the other.  Multiple armed groups opposed to the Rwandan government operate in eastern DRC and have launched occasional incursions into Rwandan territory. Shells struck Rwandan territory in this area several times in 2022. Congolese armed forces and UN peacekeepers continue to conduct combat operations against rebels, militia, and ISIS-aligned groups in DRC\u2019s North and South Kivu provinces, which abut Rwanda.  Violence, rape, kidnapping, killing, pillaging, armed robbery, and roadside criminality occur in these areas and often target civilians.

    "country_name": "Saudi Arabia",
    "Safety and Security": "The Department of State advises you to exercise increased caution when traveling to Saudi Arabia due to terrorism and the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets. See the Travel Advisory for Saudi Arabia here. Do not travel: Within 50 miles of the border with Yemen due to terrorism and armed conflict. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Terrorists have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners. Houthis operating in Yemen have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia, specifically targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure; they have publicly stated their intent to continue doing so. Missile attacks have targeted major cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah, Riyadh\u2019s international airport, Saudi Aramco facilities, and vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. Rebel groups are also in possession of unmanned aerial systems (UASs or drones) which they have used to target civilian infrastructure and military facilities in Saudi Arabia. U.S. citizens living and working on or near such installations, particularly in areas near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile and drone attack. On October 11, 2018 the Saudi General Authority for Civil Aviation issued a Notice to Airmen about threats to civil aviation and airports in Saudi Arabia posed by missiles and UASs launched from Yemen. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the U.S. Government\u2019s Defense Internet NOTAM Service (Type \u201cOEJD\u201d in the search field, then click \u201cView NOTAMs,\u201d then scroll down to W0438/18 and click to view). The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following locations as U.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from travel to: Within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the cities of Jizan and Najran; Qatif in the Eastern province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah. You can find additional details relating to safety and security in our Travel Advisory and Alerts and the website of the U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia. Crime: Crime in Saudi Arabia has increased over recent years but remains at levels far below most major metropolitan areas in the United States. You should be aware of your surroundings, keep valuables out of sight and secure, and travel with a companion, if possible. Some Saudi citizens who perceive that a foreigner is not observing conservative standards of conduct or dress have been known to harass, pursue, or assault that person. Even when released from detention, witnesses to criminal incidents may be prohibited from leaving the country until investigation of the incident is complete. See the websites of the Department of State and the FBI for information on scams. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime, you should contact the local police at \u201c999\u201d and contact the Embassy in Riyadh or one of the Consulates in Jeddah or Dhahran.Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See the Department of State\u2019s webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. The Department can: help you identify appropriate medical care; assist you in reporting a crime to the police; contact relatives or friends with your written consent; explain the local criminal justice process in general terms; provide a list of local attorneys; provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S.; provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution; help you find accommodation and arrange flights home; replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: If you are the victim of any form of physical violence, including domestic violence, you should contact the Saudi police by calling \u201c999\u201d.  In addition, victims of domestic violence can contact the Saudi National Domestic Violence Hotline by dialing \u201c1919.\u201d The Saudi Ministry of Labor and Social Development runs a network of shelters for women and children. Contacting the domestic violence hotline (\u201c1919\u201d) is the only way to access these shelters. The Saudi National Family Safety Program also runs a Child Help Line \u201c116111\u201d and can assist children in accessing Saudi social services. When reporting domestic violence, it is imperative to get a case reference number as all Saudi social and legal assistance is tied to this case number. It is also a good idea to document any injuries and obtain a copy of any medical reports. U.S. citizens should be advised that filing a police report or utilizing any Saudi victims\u2019 assistance services may result in the Saudi authorities informing your sponsor or guardian. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or Consulates for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.

Casamance region: There are sporadic reports of armed banditry in the Casamance region. Landmines from prior conflicts remain a concern, particularly in more remote parts off main roads. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Casamance region. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. While Senegal has not experienced any recent terrorist attacks, many places throughout West Africa, including Kayes Region of Mali on Senegal\u2019s border, have witnessed such violence. More generally, terrorists increasingly have utilized less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds. Frequently, they seek out unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)  Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists  Places of worship  Schools  Parks  Shopping malls and markets  Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Crime: Street crime, including robberies at knife-point and home burglaries, is common in Senegal, particularly in urban areas. Beware of pickpockets, purse-snatchers, and thieves on motorized scooters. Robberies occur regularly along the Corniche d\u2019Ouest, an area heavily frequented by tourists and westerners.  Demonstrations\u202foccur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\u202f  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.\u202f  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.\u202f  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.  International Financial Scams:\u202f See the\u202fDepartment of State and the\u202fFBI\u202fpages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Senegal.

    "country_name": "Serbia",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists worldwide are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, rudimentary Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, they target unprotected or vulnerable venues, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Anti-U.S. Sentiments: While Serbians can be welcoming to visitors, anti-U.S. sentiment is widespread and can be more prevalent around certain anniversaries and some national holidays, including: February 17 (anniversary of Kosovo\u2019s 2008 declaration of independence), between March 24 and June 10 (the anniversary of the 1999 NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia in response to events in Kosovo), and potentially June 28 (St. Vitus\u2019s Day or Vidovdan). Sporting Events: There is the potential for violence before, during, and after sporting events. There have been clashes between police and fans in the vicinity of sports venues, which are often located in residential areas.  The Embassy considers matches between certain teams, including Partizan, Rad, and Red Star, to be high risk events because of violence at previous games.  While U.S. citizens have not been targeted in the past, in a few isolated cases non-Serbians have been the victims of sports-related violence. U.S. Government employees are generally advised to avoid the vicinity of high-profile sporting events. Night Clubs: As a safety precaution due to xenophobic violence, the following clubs have been declared off-limits for U.S. Embassy personnel in Serbia: Plastic Klub \u0160lep (Shlep) Mr. Stefan Braun Crime:  Violent crime in Serbia is most often associated with organized crime activities and hooliganism surrounding high-profile sporting events. Although not traditionally the targets of violent crime, tourists and visitors should maintain a heightened awareness of their surroundings, as in all major cities. Pickpocketing and financial crimes of opportunity are the most common occurrences.  Tourists should pay attention to taxi meters and listed fares as some taxi drivers may try to scam foreigners and charge higher rates. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Maintain caution if within the vicinity of demonstrations.  There is often a heavier than usual police presence near demonstrations and traffic may slow or stop until well after the demonstration ends. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime in Serbia, you should contact the local police. Report crimes first to the local police by dialing 192.

    "country_name": "Somalia",
    "Safety and Security": "The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Somalia due to the lack of a permanent consular presence in Somalia, including the Somaliland region. U.S. citizens can contact the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. In an emergency, you will have to rely on your own resources or journey to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate outside of Somalia. Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)  Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by foreigners  Places of worship  Schools  Parks  Shopping malls and markets  Public transportation systems (including buses and scheduled commercial flights)   Checkpoints Terrorist organizations and armed groups in Somalia attack government authorities and facilities; African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) personnel and bases; and civilian and non-governmental targets, including but not limited to hotels, restaurants, airports, seaports, and shopping areas. Inter-clan and factional violence are also regular occurrences throughout Somalia. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa\u2019ida-affiliated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia, has repeatedly attacked Mogadishu\u2019s Aden Adde International Airport (AAIA) and other locations in Somalia with mortars, small arms and light weapons, and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). The group\u2019s recent attacks include a March 23, 2022, small arms and mortar attack at the AAIA compound in Mogadishu, where the U.S. Embassy, several other diplomatic posts, and the UN offices are based, which killed seven people. Later the same day, two attacks in Beledweyne killed 48 and wounded 108. On January 12, 2022, a VBIED motorcade attack approximately four kilometers from the U.S. Embassy injured two U.S. citizen contractors and killed five non-U.S. citizen employees providing security and killed an unconfirmed number of bystanders. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for all of these attacks. While some areas have experienced less severe terrorist activity, such as the Somaliland region, where there have been no major terrorist attacks since 2008, terrorist attacks involving the indiscriminate use of explosive devices and other weapons can take place anywhere in Somalia at any time without warning. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Violent crime such as kidnapping, bombings, indirect fire attacks, murder, armed robbery, carjacking, and illegal roadblocks by armed individuals in uniforms occur throughout Somalia, including the self-declared autonomous region of Somaliland. Somali authorities have limited capacity and resources to investigate and prosecute criminal activity. U.S. citizens should: Avoid walking alone, especially at night. Avoid displaying cash and valuable personal property. Dress conservatively. Carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location. Maintain caution in areas frequented by foreigners. Be cautious when traveling in major cities and along border areas. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.  Cultural Rehabilitation Centers: Some schools and other facilities acting as \u201ccultural rehabilitation\u201d centers are operating in Somalia with inadequate or nonexistent licensing and oversight. Reports of minors and young adults being held in these facilities against their will and physically abused are common. Somalia-Kenya Border: Cross-border violence attributed to al-Shabaab and skirmishes between the Somali and Kenyan armies occurs periodically, including large-scale attacks against civilians, government security forces, and AMISOM troops. Kidnapping, IED, and grenade attacks targeting international aid workers and civilians occur. Al-Shabaab actively operates in border areas, including Kenya\u2019s Lamu and Wajir counties.

    "country_name": "South Africa",
    "Safety and Security": "Alerts regarding important safety and security information such as demonstrations, road security, and weather events are posted on the Embassy\u2019s website. In South Africa the equivalent to the \u201c911\u201d emergency line is 10111. The following paragraphs provide a summary, but please read the Department of State\u2019s most recent Overseas Security Advisory Council Country Security Report on South Africa, which provides detailed information about safety and security concerns for travelers to South Africa. Civil Unrest: Strikes and demonstrations occur frequently. These can develop quickly without prior notification and occasionally turn violent, and may include the burning of vehicles, buildings, or tires \u2013 which may serve as roadblocks; throwing rocks or other objects; or physical attacks. Strikes and demonstrations can also interrupt traffic and the provision of electricity, water, public transportation, fuel, and other goods and services. Periodic incidents of mob violence directed against refugees and immigrants from other African countries occur in South Africa.  During labor protests, strike breakers or those perceived to be strike breakers have been violently attacked.  Protests involving taxis and ride hailing services can turn violent.  See Travel and Transportation section below for guidance. Precautions: Avoid demonstrations and use vigilance during your movements around the country. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent. Maintain caution in areas frequented by foreigners. Monitor news and Alerts. Crime: South Africa has a very high level of crime Violent crimes occur where people live, work, while in transit or out and about.  Violent residential crimes include armed home invasions by organized criminal groups resulting in assaults, rapes, and murder.  Popular tourist destinations and major hotel chains employ their own security that largely minimize such incidents on their properties.  Armed robbery, rape, kidnapping for ransom, carjacking, mugging, and \"smash-and-grab\" attacks on vehicles affect visitors and residents alike. Extra vigilance at traffic lights and on/off ramps where cars slow or stop is warranted.  To avoid robbery outside higher end stores when buying jewelry or electronics, many vendors will deliver your purchase to your home or hotel for a fee.  Crime can occur anywhere and anytime, including in and around Kruger National Park, and U.S. government staff and visitors have been robbed in the immediate vicinity of our diplomatic facilities. You should exercise particular caution in the central business districts (CBDs) of major cities, especially after dark. Crime victims have also been followed from the arrival hall of OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg and then robbed once they reach their home or hotel. Theft can be bold and in broad daylight.  Travelers and U.S. diplomats report having cell phones stolen from their hands, as well as purses or wallets taken off counters while paying for goods at stores.  Car theft and hijacking continues to plague the country, particularly in large cities.  Travelers should choose secure parking options and double check locked doors before leaving a parked car. Throughout South Africa, U.S. citizens should: Avoid walking alone especially after dark. Avoid visiting informal settlement areas unless you are with someone familiar with the area. Please note that U.S. mission staff are required to use fully armored vehicles when visiting many townships in and around the Cape Town area and visiting hours are restricted to between 0700-1500 hours. Do not display cash and valuables. Avoid cash-in-transit vehicles both on the road, as well as ATMs when being refilled.  Armed criminal gangs frequently target cash-in-transit vehicles while stopped at customer sites, but also ambush cash-in-transit vehicles while on the road.  Such violent armed attacks involve automatic weapons, explosives, and gangs of criminals.  Criminals frequently use remote jamming and signal interceptors with success. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location. Avoid driving during periods of load shedding (rolling blackouts) as the roads can become extremely congested due to a lack of traffic signals. These traffic jams and slow-moving traffic can provide opportunities for smash and grab robberies. Student Groups: There have been instances of student groups being robbed while conducting outreach and service visits in townships. On these occasions, student groups coordinated with officials to conduct service visits and upon arrival were held and then robbed by armed perpetrators. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in South Africa. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Contracts with promises of large commissions Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Lotteries Inheritance notices Work permits/job offers Bank overpayments Travelers need not surrender their credit card to any vendor.  They will bring a credit card machine to customers. ATM and Credit Card skimming is common and visitors should be cautious about using ATMs outside of banks and reputable hotels.  Skimmers have also been found on machines used to pay parking tickets at shopping malls and office buildings.  Paying parking fees with cash avoids this risk. See the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence should report crimes to the local police at 10111. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. The U.S. Consulates General in South Africa can: help you find appropriate medical care assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution help you find accommodation and arrange flights home replace a stolen or lost passport Terrorism Threat: Extremists with ties to international terrorist organizations, such as al-Qai\u2019ida, al-Shabaab, and ISIS, historically have used South Africa as a logistical hub to conduct recruitment and financial facilitation. There has been increased activity by ISIS sympathizers and supporters locally, including the placement of incendiary devices and kidnapping for ransom operations. South African authorities have periodically arrested individuals and charged them with terrorism related crimes. The U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control has publicly designated ISIS members operating in South Africa who have provided technical, financial, or material support to the terrorist group.  Check the Mission\u2019s website to review Alerts to U.S. citizens, and register with the U.S. Mission to South Africa to receive new Alerts by email during your travels. Game parks and outdoor safety: Visitors have been injured and killed by wild animals in South Africa. It is dangerous to leave your vehicle in game parks outside of designated areas. Observe all park regulations and follow the instructions of guides. Be mindful of sharks when swimming. Rip tides are common and very dangerous. Do not swim alone in isolated areas or dive into unfamiliar waters. Hikers must be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions and ensure they have proper clothing and supplies. Many areas, especially in the Western Cape province, experience brush fires during the summer months (December-February). These fires can burn for several days. Monitor local media and follow fire crew instructions regarding road closures and evacuations. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules regarding best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas and activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to arrive on the scene and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  Infrastructure: Currently, periodic scheduled blackouts (known locally as \u201cLoad Shedding\u201d) are common throughout the country.  These controlled rolling blackouts are employed to safeguard the country\u2019s electrical grid and has resulted in nationwide outages of up to six hours or more without power daily. These electricity outages negatively impact businesses which do not possess an alternative power supply (e.g., diesel generators) including hotels. Additionally, during periods of load shedding, traffic lights will cease functioning creating traffic jams which provide opportunities for smash and grab crime. Load shedding can also impact water availability and safety, cell phone signal, fuel pumps (and therefore fuel availability), and residential security features especially in rural areas."

    "country_name": "South Korea",
    "Safety and Security": "Public Demonstrations: Demonstrations and rallies are common in South Korea, particularly near the U.S. Embassy, Seoul City Hall, and areas surrounding military installations. You should avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or rallies. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. North Korea (The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, DPRK): An armistice agreement, monitored by the United Nations, has maintained general peace on the Korean peninsula since 1953. Tensions occasionally flare up because of provocative acts by North Korea, including ballistic missile and nuclear tests and limited armed incursions into ROK-held territory. Some provocations have escalated into geographically limited skirmishes. South Korea routinely conducts military training exercises and civil defense drills. North Korea often issues strongly-worded and threatening messages, frequently in connection with these exercises. Please see our Fact Sheet on North Korea. Weather-related Events: Heavy rains and flooding may occur during the June - August monsoon season or the May - November typhoon season. See general information about natural disaster preparedness at the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) website. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP): To receive security messages by email and make it easier to locate you in an emergency, register in STEP.  If the Embassy becomes aware of any specific and credible threat to the safety and security of U.S. citizens, we will inform you through our website, social media, and email. Crime: For most visitors, South Korea remains a very safe country. Common crimes occur more frequently in major metropolitan areas, tourist sites, and crowded markets. Take routine safety precautions. Pay attention to your surroundings. Report any concerns to local police. Violent crime is not common; however, remain vigilant: Exercise caution in crowded entertainment, nightlife, and shopping districts. If traveling at night, consider traveling in groups. Use legitimate taxis or public transportation only. Victims of Crime: Call 112 for emergency assistance or to report a crime to local authorities. Call 02-397-4114 to contact the U.S. Embassy. We can: Help you find appropriate medical care; Assist you in reporting a crime to police; Contact relatives or friends on your behalf; Explain Korean judicial procedures in general terms; Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution; Help you find accommodations and flight arrangements to the United States; Replace a lost or stolen passport. Sexual Assault: The Embassy regularly receives reports of sexual assault from U.S. citizens. Most cases involved young women assaulted by acquaintances they met on social media, dating, or messaging apps. Alcohol is often involved, and Korea\u2019s low overall crime can create a false sense of security.  Specialized hospital units and police are available in South Korea to assist victims, however services in English and responsiveness to the crime are not always consistent. In general, sex crimes are not punished as harshly in South Korea as in the United States and the road to prosecution is a challenging one for victims. Domestic Violence: Victim\u2019s assistance resources or battered women\u2019s shelters exist in Seoul and other urban areas but may be limited in rural areas. Most are government administered and require a police referral. Call 112 for emergency assistance or 1366 to reach Korea\u2019s 24-hour domestic violence hotline. Victims may also contact the Embassy, tel. (+82) 2-397-4114. Lost or Stolen Passports: If your passport is stolen, file a report at the nearest police station. Don't buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if widely available. It is against South Korean law to purchase these goods and against U.S. law to bring them into the United States. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Division in the U.S. Department of Justice has more information. Avoid fraud and scams: See Department of State and FBI websites for more information. Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage."

    "country_name": "South Sudan",
    "Safety and Security": "The U.S. Embassy\u2019s ability to provide consular services outside of Juba, even in emergencies, is extremely limited. Land mines remain a hazard, especially outside of Juba. Armed conflict between various political and ethnic groups continues throughout the country. Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Be vigilant when traveling outside of cities and avoid travel along border areas. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent. Monitor local/international news and consular messages. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan. Crime: The population has ready access to weapons due to years of civil war, inter- and intra-ethnic conflict, and political unrest. In Juba, the most frequently reported violent crimes include armed robbery, carjacking, and home invasion. Criminals target people who are walking, driving, traveling alone or in small groups, especially at night. Most criminal incidents affecting Westerners appear to target victims based on perceived wealth and vulnerability rather than nationality. Criminals frequently wear security service uniforms, carry military weapons, and use the ruse of security check points or official business to stop individuals or gain access to compounds. Outside Juba, road ambushes and roadside crime are common and often involve violence. Violent crimes (murder, armed robbery, home invasions, cattle raiding, kidnapping) and non-violent petty theft and fraud are pervasive. Throughout the country, crimes of opportunity include: Muggings Pickpocketing Theft from vehicles Fraudulent currency exchanges Thefts usually occur near restaurants, banks, or other areas in proximity of foreigners. Avoid walking alone, especially after dark. Do not display cash or valuables. Dress conservatively. Drive with doors locked and windows closed. Travel with a copy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location.  International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by going in-person to the closest police station and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(211) 912-105-188. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: Help you find appropriate medical care Assist you in reporting a crime to the police Contact relatives or friends with your written consent Provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion Provide a list of local attorneys Provide our information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home Replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

    "country_name": "Spain",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on encouraging or conducting attacks worldwide, including within Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists  Places of worship  Schools  Parks  Shopping malls and markets  Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)   Spain\u2019s open borders with its Western European neighbors allow the possibility for terrorists to enter and exit the country anonymously. Additionally, Spain\u2019s enclaves in Melilla and Ceuta on the North African coast allow for entry into Spain from the African continent. Spain has taken robust actions to guard against terrorist attacks, including arrests of suspected extremists allegedly involved in terrorist plots. Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue to plot potential attacks in Europe, including Spain. For more information, see our Terrorism page.   Crime: Pickpocketing and other minor crimes, such as theft, are very common in Spain including instances where the victim is purposefully distracted to facilitate the theft. Street crimes against U.S. citizens usually occur in  tourist areas, including airports, train stations, and both urban and beach destinations. Violent crimes, including robberies, have also been reported. Some instances have required the victim to seek medical attention. Car break-ins are also frequent in Spain. Use common sense, awareness and the same personal security measures you would normally use in any large city or tourist destination. Keep track of your passport at all times, including on flights and other modes of transportation. There have been reports of passports being stolen on planes en route to Spain. Do not leave bags unattended. Keep them in sight and avoid placing passports, cash, cell phones, or other valuables in the outer pockets of backpacks or purses on tables or floors, grounds in public places. Do not leave bags slung over the backs of chairs, on hotel or store counters, on top of your suitcase or travel bag, or out of your physical control in hotel lobbies, car rental locations, train stations, restaurants, and other public places. Avoid carrying your passport unless needed for travel, especially in tourist areas. Instead, carry a photocopy or photo of your passport\u2019s biographical information page and consider leaving your passport in a secure location, such as a hotel safe. Your passport will be required to check in into any hotel in Spain and may be required for trains or tourist sites. Sexual Assault: The U.S. Mission in Spain has received numerous reports of sexual assaults affecting U.S. citizens, especially younger travelers, students, and exchange teachers. Navigating the Spanish criminal justice system after surviving a sexual assault has been difficult for many U.S. citizen victims, who report feeling judged and re-victimized throughout the very lengthy process. Although it is not required, many U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault in Spain have found it helpful to hire a local attorney to be their advocate and defend their rights during any judicial process or use the help of the local Office of Victim\u2019s Assistance. Information about the local victim\u2019s assistance program is given out at the police station when the report is filed. There have been numerous reports alleging sexual assaults against U.S. citizen students by Manuel Blanco Vela, a representative of a tour operator based in Seville, Spain. Conduct research online to determine who owns and operates tour companies to make informed choices. Many sexual assaults occur at night or during the early morning hours. In most cases, assailants take advantage of alcohol or drugs to make victims more vulnerable. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call the toll-free emergency number in Spain, 016, for assistance, and the U.S. Embassy in Madrid at (34) 91-587-2200 or U.S. Consulate General Barcelona at (+34) 93-280-2227. Note that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence, sexual assault or other violent crimes are encouraged to report crimes to the local emergency services at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy, Consulate, or consular agency for assistance. Note that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests  and demonstrations .\u202f  Past demonstrations have turned violent. \u202f  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.    International Financial Scams:\u202fSee the\u202fDepartment of State\u202fand the\u202fFBI\u202fpages for information. Financial scams are prevalent in Spain. Beware of anyone asking for money, particularly people who establish a \u201cromantic\u201d relationship online or anyone who claims the Spanish authorities are asking them for money. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:    People claiming to be U.S. military personnel Romance/Online dating  Money transfers  Grandparent/Relative targeting  Free Trip/Luggage  Lotteries  Inheritance notices  Work permits/Job offers  Tourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules [with regards to best practices and safety inspections] are regularly enforced.

    "country_name": "Sri Lanka",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) The last terrorist attack in Sri Lanka occurred on April 19, 2019, when terrorists carried out coordinated bombings of hotels and churches in Colombo and Batticaloa, killing more than 250 people and injuring more than 500 more. The terrorists were Sri Lankan nationals associated with the Islamic groups National Thowheeth Jama\u2019ath Millathu Ibraheem. Authorities believe the perpetrators of the attack are dead or have been captured. Many hotels and shopping areas increased their physical security presence in response to the bombings and security screenings of guests and bags has become standard in many locations. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Most crimes against U.S. citizens continue to be petty crime and crimes of opportunity (e.g., pickpocketing, hotel room thefts, and fraud). There is some organized criminal activity, which can involve drug-related crimes and gang-on-gang violence, but these events do not tend to involve foreign travelers. There are occasional reports of credit card fraud. Authorities have arrested foreign nationals and organized groups for complicity in financial crimes. Avoid situations where your card is removed from your view. There have been reports of employees at reputable businesses (e.g., restaurants or chain grocery stores) wearing data skimming devices in their clothing and scanning a victim\u2019s credit card or using other methods to steal credit card information. ATM skimming is also a threat. If you use an ATM, be on the lookout for skimming devices. Cover keypads with your hand. Street hustlers are common around popular hotels, shopping areas, and other tourist sites. There are occasional reports of snatch and grab theft of purses or jewelry owned by tourists, but no recent reports of armed robberies.  Beware of tuk-tuk or taxi drivers offering \u201cspecial\u201d tours or access to festivals or gem shops. This common scam often results in tourists being heavily pressured to buy \u201cgems\u201d that are either cut glass or are worth much less than the price being asked. Likely due to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic situation, there is a scam in which a tuk-tuk driver charges your ride using an app on their phone, claiming the meter is broken. When you get close to the destination, the phone either slips down or the app closes, and they charge a much higher amount than the routine cost. If a tuk-tuk does not have a meter, agree on a price before beginning the ride, and try to have the correct amount of cash so you do not need change. Surf schools are known to run scams where they claim renters damaged their boards and demand exorbitant prices to repair the damage. Examine and take pictures of your surfboard before taking it into the water. Sexual harassment is pervasive. Both foreigners and locals, more commonly women, report instances of cat calls and physical harassment (grabbing of body parts) while in crowded areas and/or public transportation. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Past demonstrations have turned violent. Police may deploy water cannons and/or tear gas in response to violent protests. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. In general, demonstrations in Sri Lanka are peaceful, resulting only in traffic congestion. However, some have ended in violence between the protestors and police or opposition groups. Demonstrations can involve confrontations with police, resulting in the use of water cannons and tear gas to disperse crowds. Large political rallies are common. These rallies are generally peaceful but can disrupt traffic. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams occasionally occur in Sri Lanka. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited text messages and WhatsApp messages. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating  Contracts with promises of large commissions  Work permits/job offers Tips to avoid scammers: Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money. Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages. Do a reverse image search on the profile picture. If they ask for help, you should refer them to the closest U.S embassy or consulate so we can assist them. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs. Technology Usage Abroad: Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated, and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact both the tourist police (hotline: 1912 or 011-242-1451) and the U.S. Embassy (011-202-8500) for assistance. Report crimes to both the tourist police and the U.S. Embassy. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance."

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) Sweden has been subject to terrorist incidents in the past and the potential for a future terrorist incident remains.  As in other countries in the Schengen area, Sweden\u2019s open borders with its European neighbors could permit terrorist groups to enter and exit the country with anonymity. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks, but all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. For more information, see our Terrorism page. Crime: Sweden has a low crime rate, and most crimes involve the theft of personal property from vehicles, residences, and public areas. While armed violence against the public continues to be a rare occurrence, violent crimes, such as homicides and sexual assaults, can occur. The majority of violent crimes occur in Sweden\u2019s larger cities, such as Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmo. Organized crime groups have also committed armed acts against each other. Pickpocketing and petty theft are common in and around major tourist attractions, especially Stockholm\u2019s Old Town (\u201cGamla Stan\u201d) as well as at restaurants, coffee shops, amusement parks, museums, bars, airports, and on public transportation. Hotel breakfast rooms and lobbies attract well-dressed, professional thieves who blend in with guests and target purses and briefcases left unguarded by tourists and business travelers. Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are counterfeit goods illegal to bring back into the United States, but if you purchase them, you may also be breaking local law. Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Sweden. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: romance/online dating money transfers bank overpayments online relationships that evolve into requests for emergency financial assistance Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault, should first contact local police authorities by dialing 112. Crime victims may contact the U.S. Embassy at +46 (8) 785-5300 after they have contacted local authorities.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting all crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.  Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Monitor media and local information sources as well as Embassy Bern\u2019s safety and security webpage, and factor updated information into personal travel plans and activities. Address specific safety concerns to law enforcement authorities in Switzerland. Crime: The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing, vehicle break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft. Do not leave bags unattended. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, at airports, car rental agencies, on public buses, trams and trains, and at the major railway stations. Visitors to congested and popular tourist areas (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings. Be alert to criminal schemes. Organized groups of pick-pockets operate at major tourist sites and when conferences, festivals, shows, or exhibitions occur. Thieves frequently work in pairs. For example, one member of the pair creates a disturbance while the other steals your belongings. While the incidence of sexual assault is statistically low, attacks do occur. See our travel tips for Women Travelers. In many countries around the world, counterfeit and pirated goods are widely available. Transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. In addition, bringing them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 117, and contact the U.S. Embassy at +41 31 357-7011.

Alpine hazards such as avalanches and snowdrifts, landslides and flooding, glacial crevasses, falling rocks, sun exposure, and sudden weather changes are common year-round. Although safety standards are excellent, visitors need to be aware that public safety warnings are not comparable to those found in the United States. While hiking paths and ski slopes are clearly marked, not all possibly hazardous situations will have clear warning signs. People are expected to use common sense and caution when enjoying the outdoors. People should: Stay on designated paths or slopes Follow the advice given by local authorities and guides Take note of weather forecasts and conditions Be in a team of two when participating in mountain activities Inform someone of your plans and anticipated time of return Mountain rescues can be extremely expensive and we recommend that you have sufficient insurance coverage that includes coverage for mountain search and rescue. See our website for more information on overseas insurance coverage. The non-profit foundation Swiss Air Rescue Organization (REGA) offers a membership that waives the costs of rescue missions; many Swiss citizens are members and U.S. citizens are able to join as well.  Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Local organizations offer counseling and assistance for victims of crime. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.

    "country_name": "Tajikistan",
    "Safety and Security": "Potential for Terrorist Activity: Terrorist organizations, including ISIS, have a presence in the region, mostly by attracting sympathizers and followers through online platforms and social media. Terrorists have planned and carried out attacks against foreigners and government entities, such as law enforcement and security services. Tajik authorities maintain a high level of security to thwart terrorist attacks. This could lead terrorists to seek softer targets including facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate such as residential areas; clubs and restaurants; markets; places of worship; schools; hotels; outdoor recreational events, including popular hiking areas; and resorts. U.S. citizens should avoid predictable patterns of movement and revealing their personal information and location on social media. If using social media, ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set. U.S. Embassy Dushanbe employs heightened security precautions. U.S. citizens should report any unusual activity to local authorities and then inform the Embassy. Border areas with Afghanistan:  Reconsider travel near and along Tajikistan\u2019s border with Afghanistan due to terrorism. The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Additionally, the land border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has been closed since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous due to the proximity of militant groups across the border. Be vigilant when camping, biking, or sheltering in the open after dark.  U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid activities that develop predictable patterns of movement. If documenting travel on social media, please ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set. Restricted zone of Gorno-Badakhshan: Reconsider travel to Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO). The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Do not enter the Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO) region without official permission. Persons violating the law may be detained by Tajik law enforcement. Violent clashes with security forces erupted in GBAO in recent years, and the government of Tajikistan can suspend travel permits for non-Tajik citizens on short notice. To enter this restricted zone, request a special permit from Tajik embassies/consulates or from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) or the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR) registration department if applying within Tajikistan. Submit authorization requests at least two weeks in advance of your trip. If granted, authorities will annotate your passport with the names of the settlements and cities you are authorized to visit. If applying for an e-visa for tourism, you can apply for official permission to visit GBAO at the same time, for an additional fee.  Please visit the Republic of Tajikistan\u2019s e-Visa Application webpage for information on electronic visas to Tajikistan and instructions for a GBAO permit. Border areas with Kyrgyzstan: Exercise caution in areas near and along Tajikistan\u2019s border with Kyrgyzstan. Several instances of armed skirmishes between Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards have occurred, particularly in the Isfara and Vorukh districts. Unexploded landmines and cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys.  Heed land mine warning signs.  Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape.  Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails.  Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. Crime: Criminal activity in Dushanbe is moderate. Incidents are not usually violent, but muggings, armed robberies, and pick-pocketing do occur. Police do not provide adequate or immediate assistance and often will not open minor or routine cases. Other criminal activity, such as narcotics trafficking, can result in violence. Travel in pairs, especially at night. Sexual harassment of unaccompanied women is very common. Carry a copy of your passport (separate from your wallet) with you at all times. See the Department of State and the FBI webpages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault and domestic violence, should contact the police or head to the nearest hospital to seek medical attention and report the crime. Please also contact the U.S. Embassy at (992)-37-229-2000. The local equivalent to the 911 emergency line in Tajikistan is 01 for fire, 02 for police, and 03 for ambulance service, and in Dushanbe, dial 235-4545 for the State Traffic Inspectorate (GAI) police for traffic accidents. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: \u00b7   Replace a lost or stolen passport. \u00b7   Help you find appropriate medical care facilities. \u00b7   Put you in contact with appropriate police authorities. \u00b7   Contact relatives or friends with your written consent. \u00b7   Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms. \u00b7   Provide a list of local attorneys. \u00b7   Provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. Tourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place in most locations. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is for the most part not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase traveler\u2019s insurance for on-the-ground medical coverage as well as medical evacuation insurance.  Demonstrations and Protests: Both are rare in Tajikistan; however, due to security reasons, U.S. citizens are advised not to participate."

    "country_name": "Tanzania",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorist incidents, including the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, as well as occasional attacks by extremists on police stations and mosques, among other targets, highlight the threat posed by terrorism in East Africa and underscore the capacity of terrorist groups to carry out such attacks against Westerners. U.S. citizens should exercise caution when traveling between Julius Nyerere International Airport and Dar es Salaam, as there have been incidents of robberies while cars are stopped at traffic lights and kidnappings. Drivers should lock their doors and keep windows up at all times. Crime: U.S. citizens are urged to exercise caution and stay current with media coverage of local events. Report crimes to the closest police station and request a copy of the report to use for any insurance claims. Muggings, Robberies, and Assaults: Robberies are common in Tanzania. U.S citizens become victims when they hail taxis at airports, bus stations, hotels, or on the street. Victims are held until they provide passwords for credit/debit cards and are driven around town to deplete their accounts at all available ATMs. Victims are usually released hours later. A number of people have been victimized en route to the airport. To minimize risk, travelers should use marked or known modes of transport. They should also consider leaving ATM cards at home and traveling to Tanzania with a minimal number of credit cards. Stay alert when walking on beaches, footpaths, and roads; especially on Zanzibar, in Dar es Salaam, and Arusha. Avoid carrying a bag, wearing flashy jewelry, or using personal electronics while in public. If you must carry a bag, hold it by the handle loosely so you can let go quickly and not be injured if someone in a passing vehicle attempts to grab it. Do not put the strap across your chest as you can be dragged and badly injured. While on safari, visiting parks, hiking, or mountain climbing, remain alert to your surroundings and report anything unusual to your tour guide, park ranger, or the police. If someone attempts to rob you, hand over all your valuables immediately, comply with the demands, and do not make eye contact with the aggressors. ATM/Bank Fraud: To reduce your vulnerability: Minimize the amount of cash you carry. Avoid using stand-alone ATMs. Monitor your account balance regularly and immediately report unusual activity. Avoid using debit cards if possible. If you will be spending time outside of the large cities, have sufficient cash or traveler\u2019s checks for your trip. Reputable financial institutions will require the bearer of a traveler\u2019s check to present the original receipt for the checks and proof of identity before completing a transaction. If a public official attempts to solicit the payment of a fine from you, ask to travel to the nearest police station to file a report regarding the incident. Obtain a receipt and a written report of any such transactions. If your passport is seized, ask for a receipt, note the officer\u2019s name, location, and contact details and report it immediately to the U.S. Embassy. Home Invasions: U.S. citizens residing in Arusha and Dar es Salaam frequently report crimes targeting the homes of expatriates. Armed home invasions usually involve some violence and some victims have been seriously injured. If you live in Tanzania, ensure that your home has a safe haven, a secure area with reinforced barriers, where you can retreat and remain safe if intruders enter. A professional security company with 24-hour guards and roving patrols as well as the use of house alarms can help mitigate risks. Carjackings: To avoid carjackings: Drive with doors locked and windows rolled up. Do not stop in unpopulated areas. Travel in convoys if possible. Be wary of drivers of stopped cars flagging motorists down for assistance. Dar es Salaam: Exercise caution in the Coco Beach area of Tour\u00e9 Drive, the scenic beachfront road leading from the Sea Cliff Hotel into town, on Msasani Peninsula. This road is a concern any time of day or night, whether you are on foot or in a vehicle. There are regular reports of muggings, pick-pockets, and thefts from cars. Walking or jogging on the streets at any time can be hazardous because motorists can be careless, pathways abruptly end, and there are frequently no shoulders.   Zanzibar: Beware of pickpocketing, assaults, and bag snatching in Zanzibar. Wear modest dress and keep a low profile, especially on Friday afternoons, the traditional time to attend mosque. Arusha: In Arusha, the high number of foreign tourists attracts pickpockets and bag snatchers. You are strongly discouraged from walking around at dusk or at night, and encouraged to avoid the section of Arusha on the far side of the Themi River at all times when on foot. Many muggings have occurred near the clock tower in the center of town. Tanga: Criminals use the Amboni Caves north of Tanga City to hide from authorities. Police and military raid the cave system to apprehend criminals. Additionally, armed robberies in the shopping establishments of the Mzizima Ward of Tanga Rural District are common. Mwanza: Violence and attacks by armed groups in and around the city of Mwanza have increased. You should remain alert and avoid large gatherings when travelling to Mwanza. Pwani coastal region: Following an uptick in violence in April 2017, Tanzanian authorities have increased their security presence in the Pwani coastal region, about 100km south of Dar es Salaam. Additional checkpoints are in place, particularly on highways and in towns. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. VICTIMS OF CRIME: U.S. citizen victims of crime should report crimes to the local police at 111 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 255 22 229 4122 and at 255 22 229 4000, dial \u20181\u2019 for an emergency operator. Sexual Assault: Sexual assault is a risk for U.S. citizens, especially for women travelers. Victims of sexual assault should see a doctor immediately to ask about the availability of post-exposure HIV prophylaxis or other necessary medical care. They should also report crimes to local police at 111 and may contact the U.S. Embassy at 255 22 229 4122 and at 255 22 229 4000, dial \u20181\u2019 for an emergency operator. Avoid drinks given to you by strangers and do not leave your drink unattended Avoid walking after sunset, especially alone Be careful about sharing travel plans as well as personal and social media information Some police stations in Dar es Salaam (such as Oysterbay and Selander Bridge) offer a special desk for tourists to report crimes. However, they have limited daytime hours. In general, police stations may not have an English speaker available or be staffed to make a written report even during opening hours. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can: help you find appropriate medical care assist you in reporting a crime to the police contact relatives or friends with your written consent explain the local criminal justice process in general terms provide a list of local attorneys provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the U.S. provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution help you find accommodation and arrange flights home replace a stolen or lost passport Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

Periodic acts of violence in Thailand remain a concern. In August 2019, several small explosions and related arson events occurred in various locations throughout Bangkok resulting in no deaths but some injuries and minor property damage. Several small-scale bombings occurred near some tourist locations in the far Southern provinces in August 2016 and December 2018. In August 2015, an explosion near the Erawan Shrine in downtown Bangkok killed at least 20 people and injured more than 100. The U.S. Department of State assesses there is a continued risk of terrorism in Southeast Asia, including in Thailand. If a protest or demonstration is expected to pass near the U.S. Embassy or Consulate facilities, Embassy and Consulate entrances and functions may be restricted. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok\u2019s website, Facebook, and Twitter sites and the U.S. Consulate General in Chiang Mai\u2019s website, Facebook, and Twitter sites post information about local events that may affect Embassy functions. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive security and safety messages. Far Southern Thailand: Periodic violence directed mostly at Thai government interests by a domestic insurgency continues to affect security in the southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat, and Songkhla. U.S. citizens are at risk of death or injury due to the possibility of indiscriminate attacks in public places. Martial law is in force in this region. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces. Travel to this region by U.S government employees must be reviewed and approved in advance. For more information on terrorist threats against U.S. citizens worldwide and steps to take as a result of these threats, please see the Worldwide Caution. Crime: Crimes of opportunity, such as pick-pocketing, bag-snatching, and burglary, occur in Thailand. Violent crimes against foreigners are relatively rare. However, murders, rapes, and assaults against foreigners do occur. Sexually motivated violence, committed by either Thai citizens or foreigners, is most likely to occur after time spent at bars, clubs, and parties, on beaches, or in remote/isolated areas. The Thai police response will differ from an investigation in the United States; investigating officials have publicly discredited people who have reported being the victim of crimes . In addition to making a report at the police jurisdiction in which the crime occurred, we advise contacting the Embassy and engaging a local attorney if you are a victim of an assault. When traveling alone, exercise caution, stay near other travelers, and ensure friends or family know how to contact you. Taxi and \u201ctuk-tuk\u201d drivers may attempt to charge excessive fares or refuse passengers. You should either request the driver use the meter or agree on the fare beforehand. At the airport use only public transportation from the airport\u2019s official pick-up area, cars from the limousine counters, or a car from your hotel. Rental scams do occur in Thailand. Many rental motorbike, jet ski, and car companies will hold your passport until you pay for real or fictitious damages. We advise against using your passport as collateral. Exorbitant bar tab scams occur in Thailand. Some bars and entertainment venues will charge exorbitant prices for drinks or unadvertised cover charges and threaten violence if you don\u2019t pay. Other scams involving gems, city tours, entertainment venues, and credit cards are common, especially in tourist areas. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Thailand. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Grandparent/Relative targeting Free Trip/Luggage Work permits/job offers Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance.

    "Safety and Security": "Timor-Leste has experienced several episodes of violence since becoming independent in 2002. There have been no major country-wide civil disturbances since 2008, however, and international peacekeepers departed the country at the end of 2012. You should exercise caution, use common sense, avoid large gatherings, remain alert with regard to your personal security, and avoid travel after dark. Exercise caution in public places, including, but not limited to, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship, outdoor recreational events, hotels, resorts and beaches, and other locations frequented by foreigners. You should review U.S. Embassy security messages and maintain a high level of security awareness while moving around the country. Timorese security forces occasionally establish official security checkpoints along roads. You may be expected to show your passport at these checkpoints. Crime:  Pick-pocketing, purse snatching, residential and automobile break-ins, and theft occur, especially in Dili. These crimes often happen in recreational areas and facilities frequented by foreigners. Victims of crime who resist may face physical violence by perpetrators. Stone-throwing attacks on vehicles occur during gang conflicts and periods of civil unrest. Avoid travel at night or alone in unfamiliar areas. Women should avoid traveling or taking taxis alone, especially at night. Women walking or exercising alone in Dili have reported harassment, indecent exposure, and groping incidents.

Crime:  Street crime is a serious problem, and violent crime happens on a regular basis. Muggings and purse snatchings are known to occur along the beach at night and even during the day. Be aware of your surroundings, do not display large amounts of cash in public, avoid unlit areas at night, keep your car locked at all times, do not resist, and willingly hand over your possessions. The police and the military actively patrol the Ghana border due to higher crime levels. Although the border is open 24 hours, it should be avoided after dark. Vehicle Searches:  At official checkpoints during night patrols, Togolese security officials prefer that you approach with your interior light on, headlights dimmed, and have your driver\u2019s license and ID card ready. Police may inspect your car and look through the windows. Avoid giving your original passport to the police when possible. Solicitations for money or food should be ignored. Demonstrations\u202foccur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams:\u202f See the\u202fDepartment of State\u202fand the FBI\u202fpages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Togo. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles, or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:  Money transfers Lucrative sales Contracts with promises of large commissions Inheritance notices Work permits/job offersBank overpayments Victims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 and most often target police and military forces in Tunisia. Terrorists may also target crowds and unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)  The U.S. Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens in Tunisia maintain a high level of vigilance throughout the country. U.S. citizens living and working in Tunisia should understand that they accept the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks. The threat of anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury as a non-targeted bystander. Specific Areas to Avoid: Embassy Tunis regulations require advance notification to Embassy security officials of travel by Embassy personnel outside greater Tunis. Certain cities and governorates in Tunisia have a fluid and unpredictable security environment, and these areas require additional scrutiny before U.S. government personnel may travel to them. U.S. citizens should avoid the following areas due to terrorist activity: Within 30 km of Libyan border in southeastern Tunisia. Mountainous areas in the west of the country, including the Chaambi Mountain National Park area. Jendouba south of Ain Drahem and west of RN15, El Kef, and Kasserine, next to the Algerian border. Gafsa and Sidi Bou Zid in central Tunisia. The following groups, including ones on the U.S. government\u2019s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, pose a high risk to U.S. citizens in the region: The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) Al-Qa\u2019ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia (AAS-T) For more information, see our Terrorism page.  Crime:\u202f  Travelers should remain vigilant of their surroundings and take care to secure their valuables. Prominently displayed cash or jewelry may attract unwanted attention. High-value items left unattended and visible have been stolen from vehicles, hotel rooms, and private residences. Criminals have targeted tourists and business travelers for theft, pick pocketing, and scams. Incidents of theft, robbery, and burglary have been reported in upscale neighborhoods during day and night. Violent crime is rare, however, an increase in incidents of harassment and assaults against women have been reported in Tunis among the expatriate community. Some of these criminal encounters occurred in dark or isolated areas surrounding commercial zones, public beaches, and parks. Any crimes against U.S. citizens should be reported immediately to the local police and the U.S. Embassy. Report suspicious activity to the local police. Demonstrations:\u202fThey may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\u202fDemonstrations are most common on Saturday mornings and in the month of January. Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

    "country_name": "Turkey",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: The potential for terrorist attacks in Turkey, including against U.S. citizens and interests, remains high. Terrorists have previously attacked U.S. interests in Turkey, including the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul, and the U.S. Consulate in Adana. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Terrorists have also previously targeted Western tourists and expatriates. Under laws passed in 2018, Turkish security forces have an expanded legal ability to stop and search individuals and to detain individuals without charge. For your own safety: Carry a passport or identity document at all times. Follow local news sources during your stay to remain abreast of any potential areas, dates, or times of concern. Exercise caution and good judgment, keep a low profile, and maintain a high level of vigilance. Avoid demonstrations, which may become violent and unpredictable. Obey the instructions of Turkish security personnel at all times. There have also been threats and acts of violence targeting religious minorities, groups, institutions, and places of worship in Turkey. The level of anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic sentiment remains significant. Protests and gatherings: Public gatherings are common in Turkey and can include protests or demonstrations, holiday celebrations, family events, sporting events, and political events in the lead up to elections and following the announcement of election results. U.S. citizens should Avoid demonstrations and gatherings, as they may become violent and unpredictable.  Be aware celebratory gunfire is common in some areas and has resulted in deaths in recent years.  Follow local authorities instructions, police may take action to disperse the group, including possibly using teargas or detaining participants, even when the government has approved gatherings. Crime: Overall street crime in Turkey is low; however, you should use the same precautions you would take in the United States. The following types of crime have been reported in Turkey: Pick-pocketing, purse snatching, and mugging. Carry only necessary items when in tourist areas.  Residential crime occurs more often in major cities, with criminals targeting ground floor apartments for theft. Sexual assault has occurred in Turkish baths (hamams) or spas, in taxis, and when traveling alone at night. Assaults involving date rape drugs have also been reported. Confidence schemes occur where travelers are tricked into ordering food or drinks at a restaurant, and then are charged incredibly high prices. Patronize well-established restaurants and ask to see a menu with prices before ordering anything. Scams are common in Turkey, particularly internet scams involving people who met online. Typically, the person in Turkey asks the other person to wire large sums of money to provide financial assistance. Do not send money to someone you have never met in person. Exercise due diligence when purchasing jewelry, rugs, or real estate. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Eastern and Southeastern Turkey: We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens reconsider travel to specific areas in eastern and southeastern Turkey, and do not travel to areas near the Syrian or Iraqi borders. U.S. Government employees are subject to travel restrictions to the provinces of Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Hatay, Kilis, Mardin, Sanliurfa, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli and Van. Mount Ararat, in Agri province, is a special military zone, and access permission must be obtained before coming to Turkey from a Turkish Embassy or Consulate. The following incidents and activities have taken place in eastern and southeastern Turkey: Terrorist attacks: Terrorist groups, including Da\u2019esh, also referred to as The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or The Islamic State of Iraq and ash Sham (ISIS), and the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party), have conducted large-scale attacks in the area, including suicide bombings, ambushes, and the detonation of car bombs, improvised explosive devices, and other homemade weapons. The PKK has attacked Turkish military and police personnel in the eastern and southeastern provinces, occasionally harming bystanders. Restricted access: Turkish security forces control access to the southeastern provinces of Hakkari, Mardin and Sirnak along the Iraqi border, and the entire Turkey-Syria border. Do not photograph or video Turkish military operations or attempt to enter military installations anywhere in Turkey. Shootings: Turkish towns located along the border with Syria have been struck by bullets and artillery rounds that originate in Syria, some resulting in deaths or injuries. Roadblocks: Use commercial air travel whenever possible while traveling to southeastern Turkey. If road travel is necessary, drive only during daylight hours and on major highways. The Turkish Jandarma (rural police) monitors checkpoints on roads. Cooperate if stopped at a checkpoint. Be prepared to provide identification and vehicle registration. Remain calm, do not make any sudden movements, and obey all instructions. We strongly discourage the use of public transportation in the southeastern region. Demonstrations: Violent clashes have taken place between Kurdish groups and Turkish police resulting from organized demonstrations. Curfews: The Turkish Government has instituted temporary curfews in cities throughout the southeast due to blockades of certain neighborhoods by the PKK. Adhere to any locally imposed curfews. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 155 and contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate.

    "Safety and Security": "Crime: American citizens are not specifically targeted for crime in the Eastern Caribbean islands. However, crimes of opportunity such as petty larceny, burglary, automobile break-ins; as well as incidents of violent crime, such as murder, sexual assault, robbery, shootings, and drug related crimes do occasionally occur. As you would in any major metropolitan area of the U.S., use the below personnel security measures while traveling: Do not leave valuables unattended in public areas, on beaches, unsecured in hotel rooms, or in rental homes. Avoid walking alone, especially at night, on beaches, and in isolated or poorly lit locations. Go out in groups or with a companion and restrict nighttime activities to established safe and reputable venues. Use only clearly marked taxis and avoid rides with strangers. Stick to well-lit and well-traveled routes. Avoid displaying flashy jewelry, expensive electronics, and large amounts of cash. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see something suspicious or unusual contact local police to report immediately. Use added caution when shopping in crowded areas, especially during the holiday season. Use added caution when attending crowded events, celebrations, music festivals, etc. Do not leave drinks unattended in public venues as this could create a potential vulnerability for the use of \u201cdate rape\u201d drugs in furtherance of criminal activity. Do not be predictable; vary your daily routes and schedules. Do not engage in illegal activity. *Abide by the above security measures at all times, be aware of your surroundings in all areas, and use added vigilance while in isolated areas where tourists do not normally frequent.

    "country_name": "Uganda",
    "Safety and Security": "In April 2019, a U.S. citizen was kidnapped in Queen Elizabeth National Park, in the southwest region of Uganda, near the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The U.S. citizen was later released unharmed.  There is increased terrorist activity within the region. Recent events include the Ugandan Police Force reportedly foiling a planned bomb attack on churches by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Kampala; reported foiled plots of church attacks and subsequent explosive devices found in Kampala, and a fatal terror attack by ISIS-CA killing two international tourists and Ugandan driver within Queen Elizabeth National Park. Anyone can be a victim at any time; U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid large public gatherings. Communications plans are basic ways for people to ensure they can be reached while on travel or anywhere really. This includes having different types of communications (email, phone, satellite phone), letting people know when one will be in an area of cell coverage to receive messages, and providing phone numbers of the locations one will be staying etc. The State Department discusses this in the link here: https://exchanges.state.gov/us/keeping-touch. Northern and Eastern Uganda: The South Sudan-Uganda border is porous, and there are frequent reports of criminal trade and movement of people across the border. Due to the influx of refugees from South Sudan into Uganda, there is a strain on the region\u2019s health, education, and security resources. Sporadic clashes may occur along the shared border, which may be poorly demarcated; a section is under dispute in the Moyo area of northwestern Uganda, abutting the Kajo Keji area of South Sudan. Crime and conflict threat in the Karamoja region in northeastern Uganda remain volatile. The Uganda People\u2019s Defense Force actively engages criminals in the Karamoja Region, and armed confrontation between police and criminal elements can occur. Emergency medical care and auto repair services are lacking in remote areas of the Karamoja Region. The U.S. Embassy requires its employees to follow enhanced protocols when traversing the Karamoja region. Southwestern Uganda/Western Uganda: U.S. citizens traveling in southwestern Uganda along Uganda\u2019s western border with the DRC should be aware that armed groups, including those aligned with terrorist organizations such as ISIS-CA, are active in eastern DRC, along with ongoing military operations to counter the threat in the region. Travelers should review the country information page and Travel Advisory for the DRC. Refugee flows across the border can number in the thousands, and there is a risk of incursions by armed combatants and criminals. There is a potential for violence related to ethnic and tribal tensions in the western districts of Bundibuguyo, Ntoroko, and Kasese, near the border with the DRC. U.S. citizens should be vigilant and monitor local media for the latest news. There is an uptick in terrorist activity in this specific region. Attacks in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Kasese,and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha have resulted in deaths of Ugandan as well as foreign nationals. The Governments of Rwanda and Uganda closed the Rwanda-Uganda border for extended periods of time in the last year. Some shutdowns are 24-hour closures and others are only overnight closures. Travelers should ensure the border is open when attempting to travel between Rwanda and Uganda. The U.S. Embassy requires its employees to follow enhanced protocols when traversing the region from Lake Albert down to the Rwandan border. The U.S. State Department encourages overseas travelers to develop communication plans to ensure they can be reached while traveling. This includes having different types of communications (email, phone, satellite phone), letting people know when one will be in an area of cell coverage to receive messages, and providing phone numbers of the locations one will be staying etc. Demonstrations: Demonstrations in Kampala and other cities periodically occur in response to local political developments Police routinely use tear gas \u2013 and sometimes live ammunition resulting in deaths \u2013 to disperse protests in urban areas. U.S. citizens are urged to monitor media coverage of local events and be aware of their surroundings at all times. Avoid demonstrations, as even peaceful gatherings can turn violent without notice. Involvement in Local Social Issues: All U.S. citizen travelers to Uganda should ensure that they have the correct visa for their visit to Uganda. Missionary and NGO work frequently require a work visa. Travelers who plan to engage in religious or civil society activities should obtain the appropriate visa from the Embassy of Uganda before departing the United States. The Government of Uganda has shown an increased interest in the activities of foreigners working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Local authorities have been known to detain, question, and arrest foreigners in Uganda, and some visitors have been ordered removed from the country. Crime: Pick pocketing, purse snatching, and thefts from hotel rooms, parked vehicles, and vehicles stalled in traffic jams are common. Armed robberies of pedestrians and car jackings also occur, sometimes during daylight hours and in public places. Victims usually remain unharmed if they do not resist. Assaults and property snatching by boda boda (motorcycle operators and passengers) are routinely reported.  Food and drinks should never be left unattended in public. Women have reported being drugged and taken to another location and sexually assaulted. Similar tactics are used to rob individuals on public transportation. Remain with a group of friends in public, as single individuals are more likely to be targeted. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Uganda. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include: Romance/Online dating Money transfers Lucrative sales Gold purchase Victims of Crime: Victims of sexual assault should seek medical assistance and counseling immediately regarding prophylactic treatment to help prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. A list of local medical providers can be found on the U.S. Embassy website. Report crimes to the local police at 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (256) (0) 414-306-001.

    "country_name": "Ukraine",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism Activity: Credible information indicates that terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Small-scale bombings continue to occur throughout Ukraine. While most attacks are at night and appear intended to cause property damage and incite fear, multiple attacks within the past year have been fatal, sometimes occurring in populated areas during daylight hours. Please read the Travel Advisory for Ukraine before traveling. While in Ukraine, you should carry travel documents with you at all times. Potential for civil disturbances: Large-scale protests have occurred from time to time in cities throughout Ukraine. You should avoid large gatherings or protests and adjacent areas. In the past, some protests have turned violent and resulted in deaths and injuries.  Be alert and aware of your surroundings and pay attention to local news media. The Embassy will post information about sizeable planned protests on the Embassy website. Crimea: There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in Crimea as part of Russia\u2019s occupation and attempted annexation of this part of Ukraine, which the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize. There are continuing abuses against and arbitrary imprisonment of foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in Crimea, particularly abuses against individuals who are seen as challenging Russian authority on the peninsula. The U.S. government prohibits employees from traveling to Crimea and is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens there. Eastern Ukraine: U.S. citizens should not travel to the eastern parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts due to ongoing armed conflict. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in this area. U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted by gunmen representing the self-proclaimed authorities and threatened, detained, or kidnapped for hours or days. Shortages of water, power, medicine, and food supplies have also been reported in Russian-proxy-controlled territory, and widespread disorder and looting has been confirmed in these areas. Crime: Criminals may target tourists due to perceived wealth. A new professional and well-trained police force (Patrol Police) has been implemented, but police corruption remains an issue. Criminal activity, including burglaries, robberies, muggings, and pickpocketing is increasingly a problem in Ukraine. Law enforcement and emergency officials rarely speak English, and interpreters are not readily available. Muggings, attacks, armed robberies, harassment, or the drugging at nightspots of unsuspecting victims (who are then robbed and/or assaulted) have been reported. Cases of assaults in apartment building corridors, elevators, and stairwells, as well as armed break-ins and crimes involving firearms, have also been reported. Recently, there has been an increase in reports of criminals luring unsuspecting visitors to Ukraine with promises of cheap lodging and/or companionship. The criminals then forcibly abduct the visitors and proceed to make unauthorized transactions via their victims\u2019 bank cards and accounts. Many incidents of criminal activity occur on the public transport system, including the metro. When riding on public transportation or moving in crowded areas, keep your purse, bag, or backpack tightly under your arm and/or in front of your body.  See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams. Victims of Crime: U.S. citizen victim of sexual assault should report crimes to the local police at 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +38 (044) 521-5000 after hours.  Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.

The Embassy will be able to assist with contacting police and provide you with a list of local shelters. Tourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not occur everywhere. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally able to access areas outside of major cities and to provide necessary medical treatment, but it may take time for them to arrive. Local law requires foreigners to have medical insurance when traveling to Ukraine. U.S. citizens are encouraged to consider purchasing additional medical evacuation insurance when arranging their medical insurance for traveling to Ukraine."

    "country_name": "Uruguay",
    "Safety and Security": "Crime: The volume of crimes against persons and property, to include homicides, is high throughout Uruguay. Street crime, including armed robberies, theft and carjackings occur in tourist centers within Montevideo with large numbers of tourists, such as Ciudad Vieja, the Rambla, and the neighborhood around the U.S. Embassy. Even upscale residential neighborhoods, such as Punta Carretas, Pocitos, and Carrasco are not immune to criminal activity. Maintain situational awareness and practice good personal security at all times while traveling throughout Uruguay as criminals typically seek out victims in vulnerable situations. Thefts, burglaries, armed robberies, assaults, and other violent crimes are common throughout Uruguay. Criminals tend to conduct surveillance on potential targets including ATMs, residences, restaurants, vehicles, and individuals prior to committing robberies. Criminals regularly travel in pairs on motorcycles to approach unsuspecting victims with a weapon and demand personal belongings before fleeing. They attempt to catch victims off-guard by driving slowly next to their vehicles and waiting for them to get out of their car to rob them. Other times, they break car windows to steal valuables from vehicles that are parked or stuck in traffic. Be vigilant when using ATMs, especially during non-daylight hours. Criminals frequently use gas-induced explosive devices to steal from ATMs. The following Montevideo neighborhoods have higher crime rates, and official U.S. government personnel are recommended to avoid or limit travel to these areas: 40 Semanas Bella Italia Borro Casavalle Casab\u00f3 Cerro Cerro Norte Hip\u00f3dromo La Teja Marconi Malv\u00edn Norte Tres Omb\u00faes Villa Espa\u00f1ola During the summer months (December-March), many cities in Uruguay experience an increase of petty street crime, residential burglaries, and robberies, especially in beach towns such as Punta del Este, La Barra, La Paloma, Cabo Polonio, La Pedrera, and Punta del Diablo. Criminals also target vehicles traveling to these and other popular destinations. Police cars are clearly marked and equipped with cellular phones. While professional and well-trained, local police do not maintain a robust physical presence to deter criminal activity throughout Montevideo, which often results in a delayed response. Most police officers do not speak English. Demonstrations: Demonstrations, some expressing anti-U.S. sentiment, regularly occur in Uruguay, particularly near the Legislative Palace, City Hall, Parque Batlle, Plaza Libertad, and the universities in Montevideo. Protests directed toward the U.S. government, usually small in size, can occur around the U.S. Embassy. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Uruguay should avoid large gatherings or events where crowds congregate to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches. Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (598) 1770-2000 or MontevideoACS@state.gov.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Demonstrations are rare, but may occur.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues and can be accompanied by clashes between police and protesters. In the past, some clashes have resulted in deaths. Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Past demonstrations have ended in mass arrests. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Crime: Violent crime against foreign nationals is rare, but can occur, especially in larger cities, primarily during late night hours.  In urban areas, travelers are urged to take the same precautions they would take in any large U.S. city. If traveling at night, stay in well-lit areas, travel in groups, maintain a low profile, and do not display large amounts of cash. Beware of pickpockets in public places, such as tourist destinations, train stations, and local markets. Although using private cars as taxis is common in Uzbekistan, U.S. citizens, especially women, should not consider this a safe practice. U.S. citizens are encouraged to use clearly marked taxis, such as those at hotels, and should avoid riding in unmarked taxis. Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.

Crime: Although violent crime is relatively rare in Vanuatu, there is always a risk that you could be a victim of theft, burglary, sexual harassment, or sexual assault. Take reasonable precautions to avoid undue risk, especially in tourist areas. Women should avoid going out alone at night or to isolated locations. The Embassy has also received some reports of ATM or credit card number theft after a card was used in Vanuatu. While this does not appear to be widespread, travelers are advised to monitor their accounts after using their ATM or credit cards in Vanuatu for any unauthorized activity. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.

    "country_name": "Venezuela",
    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism:\u202f Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:   High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)   Terrorist groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \u2013 People\u2019s Army (FARC-EP), Segunda Marquetalia, and the Colombian-origin National Liberation Army (ELN) have expanded in Venezuela in recent years.  We are aware of reports of cooperation between FARC dissidents and the ELN in the areas of road/border checkpoints, forced displacement of communities, and narcotics trafficking. For more information, see our\u202fTerrorism\u202fpage. Crime:\u202f Violent crime is pervasive throughout Venezuela.  Venezuela has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and kidnappings are a serious concern.  Be alert of your surroundings at all times and take personal security precautions to avoid becoming a victim of crime.  Maintain a low profile, travel in groups of five or more, and provide family or friends with your itineraries prior to departure. Avoid police activity.  Corruption within the police forces is a concern, and criminals may be posing as police officers or National Guard members.  National Guard members may target U.S. citizens, especially at remote land border crossings, for bribery, extortion, or detention, possibly in collusion with criminal organizations.   Criminal gangs operate openly and with little repercussion, often setting up fake police checkpoints.  Armed robberies, including with grenades and assault rifles, take place throughout the country, including in tourist areas and institutions such as banks and ATMs, national parks, shopping malls, public transportation stations, and universities. Drugs:\u202f Do not attempt to bring any narcotics or controlled substances into Venezuela, or substances that may be confused with illegal drugs.  Do not accept packages from anyone and always keep your luggage with you.  U.S. citizens have been actively recruited to act as narcotics couriers or \u201cdrug mules.\u201d  Arrestees can expect extended jail terms under extremely difficult prison conditions. Transportation:\u202f Do not use any taxis hailed on the street.  Some taxi drivers in Caracas are known to overcharge, rob, injure, and even kidnap passengers.  Use only radio-dispatched taxis from taxi services, hotels, restaurants, and airline staff.  Do not use public transportation such as city buses and the metro (subway) in Caracas.  If you drive, be aware of attacks in tunnels and avoid obstacles in the road. Maiquet\u00eda International Airport:\u202f Only travel to and from Maiquet\u00eda International Airport near Caracas in daylight hours.  Kidnappings, robberies at gunpoint, thefts, and muggings are common.  Do not pack valuable items or documents in checked luggage.  Individuals wearing seemingly official uniforms and displaying airport or police credentials have been involved in crimes inside the airport, including extortion and robberies.  Make advance plans for transportation from the airport to your hotel or destination using a trusted party or dispatch taxi service. ATMs:\u202f Most ATMs do not accept U.S. debit or credit cards, and malfunctions are common.  Use only those located in well-lit, public places.  ATM data is often hacked and used to make unauthorized withdrawals.  Criminals target ATM users for robberies.  Many ATMs do not have cash. Demonstrations\u202foccur occasionally.\u202f They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. International Financial Scams:\u202f See the\u202fDepartment of State\u202fand the\u202fFBI\u202fpages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Venezuela.\u202f Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.\u202f Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.\u202f Common scams include:   Romance/online dating Money transfers Grandparent/relative targeting   Victims of Crime:\u202f The U.S. government has extremely limited means of providing consular services to U.S. citizen crime victims in Venezuela.  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.  Report crimes to the local police at 171, and contact the\u202fU.S. Embassy in Bogota\u202fby emailing ACSBogota@state.gov or dialing +57 (1) 275-2000 or +57 (1) 275-4021 after hours.

Colombian Border:\u202f The area within a 50-mile radius along the entire Venezuela and Colombian border is extremely dangerous.  U.S. citizens near the border are at risk of detention by Maduro regime authorities.  U.S. citizens\u202fmust\u202fobtain a visa to enter Venezuela\u202flegally.\u202f\u202fVisas are not available upon arrival.\u202f\u202fU.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods.\u202f\u202fThe Maduro regime does not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government is not granted access to those citizens.  Additionally, cross-border violence, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and smuggling are common.  Some kidnapping victims are released after ransom payments, while others are murdered.  Do not attempt to cross the land border. Tourism:\u202f No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level.\u202f Tourists participate in activities at their own risk.\u202f Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.\u202f U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\u202f See our webpage for more information on\u202finsurance providers for overseas coverage. Serious medical issues require costly medical evacuation complicated by restrictions on air travel to and from Venezuela.  Air evacuations to the United States from Venezuela may not be possible."

    "country_name": "Vietnam",
    "Safety and Security": "The Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens overseas always maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness while traveling internationally. Please visit\u202fwww.travel.state.gov\u202ffor up-to-date information.  Messages regarding weather-related events are posted here and on the Embassy/Consulate General website.  While in Vietnam you are subject to Vietnamese laws. U.S. citizenship will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, expelled, or imprisoned.\u202fIndividuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Vietnamese authorities routinely do not provide timely notification of the arrest of a U.S. citizen to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General or approval for consular officials to visit U.S. citizens. The delays for both \u2013 particularly for access \u2013 can take several weeks. Note that if you enter Vietnam with a non-U.S. passport, the Government of Vietnam has different notification and access responsibilities for the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General. See our webpage for further information.  Small-scale, peaceful protests occasionally occur in Vietnam\u2019s major cities, but large-scale demonstrations are rare. As in any country, you should avoid large protests, as they can become violent with little or no warning.  The Government of Vietnam may not allow or authorize travel to certain areas of the country that are deemed sensitive. Check with local authorities before visiting border areas to see if you need to obtain a travel permit issued by local authorities. U.S. citizens have been detained after traveling in areas close to the Vietnamese borders with the People\u2019s Republic of China, Cambodia, and Laos. These areas are not always marked, and there are no warnings about prohibited travel. Safety standards in Vietnam are not at the same level as those in the United States and vary greatly from company to company and province to province. This is especially true for fire safety codes. Travelers should be aware that many buildings, including hotels, shops, and restaurants, have limited or no fire safety equipment or emergency exits. Ground and water transportation also lack safety regulations.  Travelers to Vietnam should have no expectation of privacy and should safeguard all personal documents and electronic devices. Exercise caution when discussing sensitive or proprietary information. Crime: Crime in Vietnam is rated high. Exercise vigilance and the same commonsense security precautions you would in any major metropolitan city in the United States.  Violent crime against foreigners is rare; however, petty crimes, such as theft, bag grabs, and pickpocketing occur regularly, especially in crowded areas and tourist locations. Typically, there is a rise in petty crime during the Christmas and Tet (Lunar New Year) holiday seasons, including during the day and in well-lit areas. Motorcyclists are known to snatch bags, cameras, cell phones, and other valuables from individuals riding or walking on the street. If you are targeted by thieves, do not resist, and report the incident immediately to local police and to the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi or the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City. Keep a tight hold on bags as you enter and exit vehicles and as you walk around. Hold tightly to cell phones when using them outside and lock and stow phones until you actually need to use them. Some U.S. citizens have reported threats of death or physical injury connected to business-related disputes. You should report such threats to local authorities and if you feel unsafe, you should depart the country.  Keep your passport and other important valuables in your hotel in a safe or another secured location at all times and carry both photo and digital copies of your passport. You should immediately report the loss or theft of your U.S. passport to the local police and the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Consulate General. See section on \u201cVisas\u201d for information on what to do if your passport/visa are lost or stolen. Sexual Assault: Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault, harassment and rape do occur. To minimize the risk avoid travelling alone, especially at night; remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas; and be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Local authorities may not always respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Male violence against women and sexual harassment is often ignored by the police. In areas foreigners frequent, women have reported harassment and assault such as men exposing themselves, asking for sexual favors, and groping. Drugs: Recreational drugs available in Vietnam can be extremely dangerous and can result in death. Drugs sold in Vietnam may be fake, synthetic, or laced with toxic ingredients undetectable to the buyer. This includes nitrous oxide balloons widely available in nightlife establishments. You should also avoid purchasing liquor or cigarettes from street vendors or strangers, as the authenticity of the contents cannot be assured.  Victims of Crime:\u202f U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General for assistance. Vietnam\u2019s local equivalent of an emergency line is 113. Local police will issue a report of a crime, but generally will only initiate investigations for crimes they determine serious, which do not always equate with U.S. standards. Investigations can take several months or even years to complete. In the event you are a victim of a crime, local police will issue a crime report in Vietnamese, but generally will only initiate investigations for crimes they determine serious. While the overall situation is improving, some police have asked for bribes, ostensibly to support local police efforts or to facilitate investigation of a crime. If you are involved in a situation where a police officer is soliciting money, contact American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We can:  Help you find appropriate medical care.  Assist you in reporting a crime to the police.  Contact relatives or friends with your written consent.  Provide general information regarding the victim\u2019s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion.  Provide a list of local attorneys. Provide information on victim\u2019s compensation programs in the United States.  Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited support in cases of destitution. Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home. Replace a stolen or lost passport. Domestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy or Consulate General for assistance. Note that local authorities take a different attitude towards domestic violence cases and are hesitant to get involved in cases involving foreigners. Vietnam has very limited infrastructure to support victims of domestic violence. Tourism:\u202f The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

    "Safety and Security": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013 including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.) Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists Places of worship Schools Parks Shopping malls and markets Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights) For more information, see our Terrorism page. Since the beginning of the current conflict in September 2014, the Houthis, who control Sana\u2019a, have detained U.S. citizens, including dual Yemeni-American citizens.  Reports indicate that U.S. citizens are targeted by virtue of their citizenship, regardless of the amount of time they have spent in Yemen, their established connections with rebel groups, or their connections with local businesses or humanitarian organizations aimed at providing relief to those in need.  During their detentions, which in some cases have lasted years, U.S. citizens have not been allowed contact with their families or visits by U.S. consular personnel or international humanitarian organizations.  The U.S. government is severely limited in what assistance it can directly provide to U.S. citizens in detention.  There has been no U.S. government diplomatic presence in Yemen since the Houthi takeover of Sana\u2019a. In addition to the threat of detention by rebel groups, both the ongoing conflict and heightened terrorist activity, including kidnappings for ransom, present a threat to U.S. citizens in Yemen. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition initiated an air campaign in support of the exiled Yemeni government.  Violence, armed conflict, and artillery shelling persist in areas throughout the country.  While truce agreements may reduce overall levels of violence, instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain at a severe level. Vessels in the region of the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Aden, should operate under a heightened state of alert as increasing tensions in the region escalate the potential for direct or collateral damage to vessels transiting the area. These threats may come from a variety of different sources such as missiles, projectiles, or waterborne improvised explosive devices. Piracy in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean remains a security threat to maritime activities in the region. In recent years, there have been hundreds of documented pirate attacks in Yemeni territorial waters in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) has also advised that elevated regional tensions have increased the risk of maritime attacks being conducted by extremists to vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Bab al-Mandeb regions. MARAD recommends vessels at anchor, operating in restricted maneuvering environments, or at slow speeds should be especially vigilant and report suspicious activity. U.S. flag vessels that observe suspicious activity in the area are advised to report such suspicious activity or any hostile or potentially hostile action to COMUSNAVCENT battlewatch captain at phone number 011-973-1785-3879. All suspicious activities and events are also to be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802, 202-267-2675, or TDD 202-267-4477. For further information, see the Department of State\u2019s International Maritime Piracy Fact Sheet and the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) advisory on vessels transiting high risk waters. Other potential hazards to overland travelers include landmines and unexploded ordnance. This is of particular concern in the six southern provinces and in the northern highlands. Please note that the local equivalent to the \u201c911\u201d emergency line in Yemen is 199, but operators do not speak English. Crime: Due to the ongoing civil unrest and weak government institutions, travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local authorities.  Foreigners are frequently the target of kidnapping and carjacking, particularly when traveling outside of urban areas. International Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.  Victims of Crime: The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.  Report crimes to the local police at 199.  As there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen at this time, you should coordinate with a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country for services.   See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. Domestic Violence:  The law in Yemen protects against domestic violence under general prohibitions of violence, but authorities do not enforce this provision effectively. The law criminalizes rape, but not spousal rape. Authorities may prosecute rape survivors on charges of fornication if the perpetrator is not charged with rape. According to law, without the perpetrator\u2019s confession, the rape survivor must provide four male witnesses to the crime. The law allows leniency for persons found guilty of committing an \u201chonor\u201d killing or violently assaulting or killing a woman for perceived \u201cimmodest\u201d or \u201cdefiant\u201d behavior. The law does not address other types of gender-based abuse, such as forced isolation, imprisonment, and early and forced marriage. See section 6 of our Human Rights Report for additional information. As there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen at this time, U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should coordinate with a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country.  The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen. Tourism:  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place in Yemen on any level. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk.  Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage."
